# Models & Access

CoWork OS is a **free, open-source AI super app powered by a multi-provider agent harness**.
The app itself does not require a CoWork subscription. To run AI tasks, connect a supported
provider account, API key, compatible gateway, cloud credential, or local model.

> **Cost and eligibility:** CoWork does not proxy or resell model access. Provider eligibility,
> plan limits, usage charges, and third-party-harness rules remain with each provider and can
> change independently of CoWork.

The surrounding CoWork workspace stays consistent when routes change: tools, skills, memory,
agents, approvals, artifacts, automations, and task context belong to the CoWork harness.
Individual models still differ in tool use, vision, reasoning, streaming, caching, and context
limits.

Provider or subscription access answers **which model can respond**; the task
[access profile](access-profiles.md) answers **what that task may do**. A
provider account, API key, or local model does not grant command tools,
filesystem, network, domain, connector, or device access, and changing models
does not widen the active profile.

## Access Types

### Supported accounts and subscriptions

Account-based routes use provider-controlled authentication. They are not universal
subscription compatibility, and an eligible plan does not guarantee that every request is
included in a subscription allowance.

### APIs, gateways, and cloud credentials

Direct API routes are billed by the configured provider. Compatible endpoints and gateways
let organizations use existing routing infrastructure while keeping the CoWork work surface.

### Local models

Ollama, MLX-LM, Hugging Face local routes, and the optional Atomic Chat adapter can keep inference on the machine. Cloud routes send
prompts and authentication data to the configured provider as required to complete requests. See
the dedicated [MLX-LM Local Inference guide](mlx-lm.md) for Apple Silicon setup, runtime details,
and troubleshooting. See [Atomic Chat inference](atomic-chat.md) for the inference-only local API
integration.

## Ordered LLM Fallback Chains

CoWork OS can route a task through an explicit provider/model fallback chain instead of relying on a single primary provider.

Configure this in **Settings > AI & Models**:

- choose your primary provider/model
- add fallback providers in order
- optionally choose capability-based routing for workflow phases or specialized tasks

Fallback chains are used when a provider is unavailable, rate-limited, rejected by policy, or lacks the required capability for the task. Runtime surfaces in the app and Mission Control show the active provider, routing reason, and whether a fallback occurred.

For LLM chains, retryable provider failures such as `429` rate limits and transient upstream errors move execution to the next configured provider/model in the ordered list. Once a fallback route is active, CoWork OS preserves that working route briefly so retries do not immediately bounce back to the primary provider.

You can control when the primary route is tried again in **Settings > AI & Models > Provider Failover > Retry primary after (seconds)**:

- leave it blank to use the default 60-second cooldown
- set it to `0` to retry the primary on the next route refresh
- set a value up to `3600` seconds to keep the active fallback route longer before probing the primary again

---

## Mixture of Agents

Mixture of Agents is a virtual LLM provider for preset-based model collaboration. A preset runs one or more reference advisor models first, then passes their bounded advisory notes to a final aggregator model that answers the task.

Configure it in **Settings > AI & Models > AI Model > Mixture of Agents**:

- create an enabled preset
- choose the aggregator provider/model
- add reference advisor provider/model slots
- tune advisor token limits, advisory context size, and advisor concurrency
- save settings, then select **Mixture of Agents** as the provider and the preset as the model

Advisor calls are intentionally tool-free. The aggregator receives the original task messages, tools, and tool choice, so workspace edits, shell commands, browser actions, and MCP calls still happen through the final route.

MoA has two failover layers:

- slot-level failover from each selected provider's own fallback chain
- optional MoA-provider failover for falling back from the whole preset to another provider/model

MoA does not automatically inherit global fallback providers. Configure MoA provider failover only when you want the entire preset to fall back after the MoA route fails.

See [Mixture of Agents](mixture-of-agents.md) for preset design, runtime behavior, UI testing, and corporate TLS troubleshooting.

## Prompt Caching

CoWork OS enables prompt caching by default in `auto` mode for supported model routes. The cacheable prefix is built from session-scoped prompt sections, while volatile turn context stays outside the stable prefix so follow-ups and routed turns can keep reusing the same provider-side foundation.

### Strategy by provider family

- **Claude API / Azure Anthropic / Anthropic-compatible**: CoWork sends structured `systemBlocks` and prefers Anthropic automatic caching. If a route rejects automatic cache control, the session downgrades to explicit Anthropic breakpoints.
- **OpenRouter Claude**: CoWork uses explicit cache breakpoints over the stable system prefix plus the last 3 non-system messages, with a maximum of 4 total breakpoints.
- **OpenAI / Azure OpenAI**: CoWork derives a deterministic stable-prefix cache key and sends it through OpenAI-style prompt-cache fields. This keeps GPT routes such as `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.4-mini` aligned under the same stable-prefix strategy.
- **OpenAI ChatGPT subscriptions**: CoWork forwards the stable cache session and the configured short/long retention to the Codex Responses transport, so subscription calls use the provider's cache-write path as well as API-key calls.
- **OpenRouter automatic routes**: CoWork participates in stable-prefix partitioning and cache-epoch tracking, sends model-scoped OpenRouter session affinity, and does not add Anthropic-specific markers.
- **OpenRouter Qwen/DeepSeek explicit-cache routes**: CoWork uses Anthropic-compatible `cache_control` breakpoints where OpenRouter documents that syntax; other OpenRouter models use router-managed implicit caching and fall back cleanly if a route rejects the optional metadata.
- **Bedrock Claude and Pi-backed Claude/OpenAI routes**: CoWork forwards the provider-native cache retention controls (Bedrock cache points or pi-ai cache options) and preserves cache-read/cache-write usage in telemetry.

### What stays cacheable

Cacheable prefix material comes from stable session-scoped sections such as:

- identity and safety core
- workspace / worktree context
- mode and task-domain contracts
- role, personality, and guidelines
- tool policy and rendered tool schema

Dynamic turn-scoped material such as current time, layered memory sections (`<cowork_hot_memory>`, `<cowork_structured_memory>`), and turn guidance is intentionally kept outside the stable prefix. Session transcript recall, verbatim quote recall, archive recall, and topic-pack recall are tool-driven, so they only enter the active turn after explicit `search_sessions`, `search_quotes`, `search_memories`, or `memory_topics_load` use.

### Defaults and overrides

- Default mode: `auto`
- Default TTL: `5m`
- Optional long TTL: `1h`
- Advanced disable: set `promptCaching.mode` to `off` in saved LLM settings or launch with `COWORK_PROMPT_CACHE_MODE=off`
- Advanced TTL override: `COWORK_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL=5m|1h`

### Telemetry

When an upstream provider reports prompt-cache usage, CoWork records:

- `cachedTokens`: tokens served from the provider cache
- `cacheWriteTokens`: tokens spent creating or extending the cache entry, when available
- `cacheWriteTtl`: the provider-reported `5m` or `1h` write window when available; otherwise CoWork uses the configured request TTL for local cost estimation

These values flow into Usage Insights and cost accounting.

## Model Prices and Context Limits

Cost estimates, cost budgets and context-window sizes come from a price list generated from the public [models.dev](https://models.dev) catalogue (`src/shared/model-metadata.json`).

- **Bundled with each release.** A weekly CI job (`.github/workflows/model-metadata-sync.yml`) runs `npm run models:sync` and opens a pull request when prices or models change.
- **Live provider data.** When CoWork lists OpenRouter models, OpenRouter's reported prices and context lengths take precedence.
- **Optional daily refresh (off by default).** Enable **Refresh model prices and context limits daily** in **Settings > AI & Models > Model Access** to download the models.dev catalogue once a day between releases. It is one anonymous `GET https://models.dev/api.json` with no prompts, usage data or identifiers; set `COWORK_DISABLE_MODEL_METADATA_REFRESH=1` to block it entirely.
- **Unknown models are not free.** A model without a price shows cost as **Unknown** (or `$x+` when some usage was priced). Usage Insights counts these calls separately, and cost budgets cannot account for them.
- **Local models** (Ollama, MLX, Atomic Chat) and OpenRouter `:free` routes are counted as $0.
- **Per-task cost:** the task panel's **Cost** section shows spend so far, the cap that applies (the task's own budget or **Settings > Guardrails**), and token counts; on a finished task it is the receipt. Before any usage it shows the typical cost of a task on the selected model, from your own last 30 tasks (computed locally).
- **Newer Claude tokenizer:** Opus 4.7 and later (including Opus 5.x and Fable) produce up to ~1.35x as many tokens for the same text. Costs use the provider's reported token counts, so they are unaffected; CoWork's own context estimate is scaled so compaction runs early enough.

Retired models and deliberate exceptions live in `src/electron/agent/llm/pricing-overrides.ts`. `pricing-coverage.test.ts` fails when a model CoWork offers has no price.

## Adaptive Output Budgeting

When `COWORK_LLM_OUTPUT_POLICY=adaptive` is enabled, CoWork OS applies a shared output-budget policy for agentic execution turns across the main provider families instead of relying on provider defaults.

### What it covers

The current rollout resolves explicit output limits for:

- Anthropic-family routes
- Bedrock Claude routes
- OpenAI routes
- Azure OpenAI routes
- Gemini routes
- OpenRouter routes
- a conservative generic fallback for the remaining providers

This policy currently targets execution and follow-up turns first. Explicit chat keeps its separate behavior for now, and `legacy` mode preserves the older executor path.

### Default request budgets

Internal defaults are:

- first execution turn: `8000`
- tool-follow-up turn: `16000`
- one-shot escalated retry after truncation: `48000`
- one-shot escalated retry for Anthropic-family routes: `64000`
- generic fallback escalation: `16000`

Budget selection is resolved in this order:

1. task-level `agentConfig.maxTokens`, when present
2. `COWORK_LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`
3. adaptive family defaults
4. final clamping by known hard caps and context headroom

### Transport fields by provider shape

CoWork maps the chosen budget into the provider-appropriate request field:

- `max_tokens` for Anthropic-style, OpenRouter-style, and most compatible chat-completions routes
- `max_completion_tokens` for newer OpenAI-style reasoning/chat-completions routes
- `max_output_tokens` for Gemini and OpenAI-style responses routes

This mapping is resolved centrally so execution behavior stays consistent even when providers differ in field names.

### Truncation recovery behavior

If an execution turn hits the output limit:

1. CoWork retries the same request once with a larger budget
2. if the retried response still truncates but contains visible partial output, CoWork falls back to a continuation prompt
3. if the retried response contains only reasoning or no usable answer text, CoWork stops retrying continuations and surfaces targeted guidance instead

This avoids wasting turns on repeated truncation loops that produce no visible answer.

### Internal controls

This rollout is currently controlled by environment flags rather than UI settings:

- `COWORK_LLM_OUTPUT_POLICY=legacy|adaptive`
- `COWORK_LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`
- `COWORK_LLM_AGENTIC_INITIAL_MAX_TOKENS`
- `COWORK_LLM_AGENTIC_ESCALATED_MAX_TOKENS`

`COWORK_LLM_OUTPUT_POLICY` defaults to `legacy` unless explicitly set. `COWORK_LLM_TOOL_RESPONSE_MAX_TOKENS` remains available for legacy compatibility but is no longer the primary behavior in adaptive mode.

## Azure Anthropic

Use Azure-hosted Claude models through your Azure subscription.

### Setup

1. Deploy a Claude model in your Azure AI Studio account.
2. Open **Settings > AI & Models > Model Access** and select **Azure Anthropic**.
3. Enter your Azure API key, endpoint URL (e.g. `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com`), and deployment name.

### Notes

- Uses the Anthropic messages API format, not the Azure OpenAI format.
- Separate from the existing **Azure OpenAI** provider — use this for Claude models, Azure OpenAI for GPT models.
- All billing goes through your Azure subscription.

## Ollama (Local LLMs)

Run inference locally without hosted-model usage charges. After the required models and dependencies are installed, this route can operate offline; hardware and electricity costs remain yours.

### Setup

```bash
brew install ollama
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama serve
```

### Recommended Models

| Model             | Size | Best For             |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------------------- |
| `llama3.2`        | 3B   | Quick tasks          |
| `qwen2.5:14b`     | 14B  | Balanced performance |
| `deepseek-r1:14b` | 14B  | Coding tasks         |

---

## HuggingFace Local AI (`hf-agents` + `llama.cpp`)

Run compatible local models through CoWork's HuggingFace Local AI provider.

### Setup

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
hf extensions install hf-agents
```

Then open **Settings > AI & Models > Model Access**, choose **HuggingFace Local AI**, select or enter a model, and start the local `llama.cpp` server from the provider panel.

### Notes

- Default local endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/v1`
- API key is optional for local runs
- Best fit when you want a private local provider but do not want to depend on Ollama

---

## MLX-LM (`mlx`)

Run quantized models natively on Apple Silicon through Apple's open-source MLX framework and
the MLX-LM OpenAI-compatible local server. The complete setup, API, lifecycle, privacy, and
troubleshooting contract is documented in [MLX-LM Local Inference](mlx-lm.md).

### Setup

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade mlx-lm
```

Then open **Settings > AI & Models > Model Access**, choose **MLX (Apple Silicon)**, select a
model, and start the **MLX Server**. CoWork connects to `http://localhost:8080/v1`.

Recommended starting models:

- `mlx-community/Qwen3-8B-4bit` for a smaller, faster local model
- `mlx-community/Qwen3-14B-4bit` for a balanced model
- `mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit-DWQ` for larger Apple Silicon systems

The MLX server downloads models from Hugging Face on first use and keeps inference local. It is
intended for local development, not as a production-exposed service.

---

## Atomic Chat (Local)

CoWork can connect to an already-running [Atomic Chat](https://atomic.chat/)
instance through its OpenAI-compatible API. This route is an inference adapter:
CoWork keeps ownership of the task loop, tools, permissions, approvals,
evidence, and persistence. It does not start Atomic Chat, install models, or
import Atomic Agent's tool loop.

### Setup

1. Start Atomic Chat and load a model.
2. Open **Settings > AI & Models > Model Access** and choose **Atomic Chat
   (local)**.
3. Keep the default endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:1337/v1`, or enter the endpoint
   exposed by the running instance.
4. Use **Refresh Models** and select the exact model ID returned by `/v1/models`.
5. Add an API key only when the Atomic Chat proxy requires authentication.

The initial adapter uses non-streaming `/v1/chat/completions` requests with a
60-second inference deadline. Discovery has a five-second deadline and retains
the existing model selection when discovery fails. See [Atomic Chat inference](atomic-chat.md)
for typed failure states, troubleshooting, and qualification limits. The
optional [local-model execution profile](local-model-execution.md) adds bounded
budgets and local admission control without changing the permission model.

---

## Google Gemini

1. Get API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Configure in **Settings** > **Google Gemini**

Models: `gemini-2.0-flash` (default), `gemini-2.5-pro` (most capable), `gemini-2.5-flash` (fast)

---

## OpenRouter

Access multiple AI providers through one API.

1. Get API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. Configure in **Settings > AI & Models > Model Access > OpenRouter**

Available: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and more — see [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models)

### Jev decision support

CoWork also supports [Jev Decision Support](jev.md) as a separate structured
decision route. Jev can choose an agent team and leader for Collaborative mode
and `/multitask`, and Active harness mode can make bounded model-routing,
task-strategy, lane, browser, loop, context, skill/tool, output, and tool-review
decisions without replacing the OpenRouter chat model that executes the work.
Jev tokens and provider-reported cost are recorded separately from normal LLM
usage; Jev does not use the LLM pricing table.
To use the OpenRouter route for Jev, save the OpenRouter key here,
then select **OpenRouter** in **Settings > AI & Models > Jev** and leave key
reuse enabled. The same key is used once for both routes.

### Pareto Code Router

OpenRouter's Pareto Code Router is available as a normal OpenRouter model selection, not as a separate provider:

| Model ID                       | Display name               | Use when                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openrouter/pareto-code`       | Pareto Code Router         | You want OpenRouter to choose a strong coding model from its coding frontier                       |
| `openrouter/pareto-code:nitro` | Pareto Code Router (Nitro) | You want the same coding-score routing, but prefer the fastest measured model in the selected tier |

When one of those models is selected, **Settings > AI & Models > OpenRouter** shows a **Pareto Router** field for the optional minimum coding score.

- `min_coding_score` is a decimal number from `0` to `1`; do not enter percentages such as `80`.
- Leave the field blank to let OpenRouter use its default strongest/high coding tier.
- Current OpenRouter tiers are `>= 0.66` for high, `0.33` to `< 0.66` for medium, and `< 0.33` for lower-cost low-tier routing.
- The score is sent through OpenRouter's `pareto-router` plugin only for `openrouter/pareto-code` and `openrouter/pareto-code:nitro`.
- In headless or VPS installs, pass the same value through Control Plane as `settings.paretoMinCodingScore`, for example `{"providerType":"openrouter","model":"openrouter/pareto-code","settings":{"paretoMinCodingScore":0.8}}`.
- The response `model` field can report the concrete underlying model that handled the request, so usage and cost records may show a Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, or other routed model rather than the router id.
- The fallback local catalog lists both Pareto models with OpenRouter's documented `200,000` token context. When the live OpenRouter model catalog returns metadata, CoWork keeps the live catalog value instead of overriding it.

The Pareto Router itself adds no extra fee. Billing follows whichever underlying OpenRouter model handles the request, so cost can vary by tier and availability.

Reference: [OpenRouter Pareto Router docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/routing/routers/pareto-router) and [Pareto Code Router model page](https://openrouter.ai/openrouter/pareto-code).

CoWork OS also sends OpenRouter app attribution headers by default so usage is associated with the app in OpenRouter analytics and rankings. The current defaults are:

- `HTTP-Referer: https://github.com/CoWork-OS/CoWork-OS`
- `X-OpenRouter-Title: CoWork OS`
- `X-Title: CoWork OS`
- `X-OpenRouter-Categories: personal-agent,programming-app`

The category pairing is intentional: CoWork OS is positioned primarily as a personal AI agent, with programming workflows as a secondary fit.

For prompt caching, OpenRouter Claude routes use explicit Anthropic-style cache breakpoints, while GPT-style OpenRouter routes participate in the shared stable-prefix prompt-cache pipeline.

## OpenAI / ChatGPT

- **Option 1: API Key** — Standard pay-per-token access to GPT models
- **Option 2: ChatGPT OAuth** — Sign in with an eligible ChatGPT account

### Models with ChatGPT OAuth

The current built-in catalog includes the following GPT-5.6 Codex routes. The
signed-in account and OpenAI backend remain the source of truth for which models
and controls are actually available:

| Model ID        | Reasoning efforts                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `gpt-5.6-sol`   | Low, Medium, High, Extra High (`xhigh`), Max, Ultra |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | Low, Medium, High, Extra High (`xhigh`), Max, Ultra |
| `gpt-5.6-luna`  | Low, Medium, High, Extra High (`xhigh`), Max        |

Reasoning effort is a request control, not a separate model ID. Choose the
model first, then set its effort from either:

- the main model picker's **Intelligence** section for the active task route
- **Settings > AI & Models > OpenAI Request Controls** for the saved OpenAI
  provider configuration

The UI only lists efforts supported by the selected GPT-5.6 model. In
particular, Ultra is available for Sol and Terra but not Luna. Max requests the
deepest standard reasoning mode; Ultra requests maximum reasoning with the
ChatGPT/Codex automatic task-delegation mode. The selected effort and response
verbosity are forwarded to the ChatGPT Codex Responses transport for OAuth
requests.

All three GPT-5.6 models support Low, Medium, and High response verbosity. The
verbosity control changes final-answer detail independently of reasoning
effort.

Model and effort availability remains account-, plan-, and entitlement-dependent.
If a model is listed locally but the ChatGPT backend rejects it, refresh the
model list, confirm the signed-in account has access, or select an available
model/effort combination.

---

## xAI / Grok

CoWork OS supports Grok through either direct xAI API billing or a browser OAuth account connection. Account eligibility, model access, limits, and charges remain controlled by xAI.

### Option 1: Grok Account Connection

Use this when the OAuth route is available to your xAI account and you do not want to manage an `XAI_API_KEY`.

1. Open **Settings > AI & Models > Model Access**.
2. Select **Grok OAuth** or open the **xAI** provider panel and choose the account connection shown there.
3. Click **Sign in with Grok**.
4. Complete the xAI browser sign-in and consent flow.
5. Refresh the model list and select a model available to the connected account.
6. Click **Test Connection**, then save settings.

CoWork stores the OAuth tokens in encrypted LLM settings for the current profile and refreshes the access token before model calls. Logging out from the same panel clears the stored xAI OAuth tokens without removing an xAI API key.

### Option 2: xAI API Key

Use this when you want pay-per-token API billing through the xAI developer console.

1. Create or copy an API key from [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai/).
2. Open **Settings > AI & Models > Model Access** and select **xAI API Key**.
3. Paste the key, click **Refresh Models**, choose a model, then save.

### Models

The built-in Grok catalog provides fallback model metadata for the OAuth route. Refreshing models against the connected account is the source of truth:

| Model ID                       | Notes                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `grok-4.3`                     | Default OAuth model for chat and reasoning |
| `grok-4.20-0309-reasoning`     | Reasoning variant                          |
| `grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning` | Non-reasoning variant                      |
| `grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309`   | Multi-agent variant                        |

### Transport and endpoint

The OAuth route uses xAI's Responses-style endpoint at `https://api.x.ai/v1`. The direct API-key route continues to use the OpenAI-compatible xAI API path. The **Base URL** field can override the endpoint for either mode when xAI changes deployment requirements or when testing a compatible gateway.

### Troubleshooting

- If the browser sign-in times out, start **Sign in with Grok** again. The loopback authorization window is intentionally finite.
- If the callback port is busy, CoWork falls back to an ephemeral local port automatically.
- If token refresh fails because the xAI session was revoked, disconnect the Grok account in Settings and sign in again.
- If a model call fails with an account, plan, or entitlement error, refresh the model list and confirm that xAI permits the requested route for the signed-in account.

## Web Search Providers

Multi-provider web search for research tasks with automatic retry and fallback. DuckDuckGo is built-in and requires no setup — it serves as a free fallback so web search always works, even without API keys.

| Provider                 | Types             | API Key                 | Best For                                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **DuckDuckGo**           | Web               | Not required (built-in) | Zero-config free fallback                    |
| **Tavily**               | Web, News         | Required                | AI-optimized results (recommended)           |
| **Exa**                  | Web, News         | Required                | Semantic search and research-heavy retrieval |
| **Brave Search**         | Web, News, Images | Required                | Privacy-focused                              |
| **SerpAPI**              | Web, News, Images | Required                | Google results                               |
| **Google Custom Search** | Web, Images       | Required                | Direct Google integration                    |

DuckDuckGo is always available as the last-resort fallback. When paid providers are configured, they are tried first in the configured order, with DuckDuckGo only used if all others fail. Search settings also support explicit primary/fallback ordering and provider cooldown behavior after repeated failures.

Configure paid providers in **Settings** > **Web Search**.
