# Knowledge Graph System

CoWork OS includes a built-in knowledge graph that provides structured entity and relationship memory for the agent. Unlike flat-text memory, the knowledge graph stores typed entities, directed relationships, timestamped observations, and optional temporal validity windows in a normalized SQLite schema with full-text search.

Graph extraction, search, and memory promotion run beneath the task's [access
profile](access-profiles.md). A graph result is context, not a permission
grant: it cannot widen filesystem, command-tool, network, connector, or export
access, and background extraction skips or fails closed when the profile does
not permit the required read path.

## Schema

### Entity Types (`kg_entity_types`)

Defines the vocabulary of entity types. 10 built-in types are seeded per workspace on startup. Users and agents can create custom types.

**Built-in types:**

| Type           | Icon                   | Description                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| person         | :bust_in_silhouette:   | A person or individual                     |
| organization   | :office:               | A company, team, or organization           |
| project        | :file_folder:          | A project or initiative                    |
| technology     | :gear:                 | A programming language, framework, or tool |
| concept        | :bulb:                 | An abstract idea, pattern, or principle    |
| file           | :page_facing_up:       | A file or document in the codebase         |
| service        | :wrench:               | A running service, microservice, or daemon |
| api_endpoint   | :electric_plug:        | An API endpoint or route                   |
| database_table | :card_file_box:        | A database table or collection             |
| environment    | :globe_with_meridians: | A deployment environment                   |

### Entities (`kg_entities`)

Core nodes in the graph. Each entity has a type, name, optional description, flexible JSON properties, confidence score (0-1), and source tracking.

**Unique constraint:** `(workspace_id, entity_type_id, name)` ensures no duplicate entities of the same type and name within a workspace.

### Edges (`kg_edges`)

Typed directed relationships between entities.

**Built-in edge types (15):**
`uses`, `depends_on`, `part_of`, `created_by`, `maintained_by`, `deployed_to`, `connects_to`, `extends`, `implements`, `references`, `owns`, `belongs_to`, `related_to`, `blocked_by`, `replaced_by`

Custom edge types are also supported.

Edges can also carry:

- `valid_from`: when the relationship became true
- `valid_to`: when the relationship stopped being current

Current facts are protected by a partial unique index on `(workspace_id, source_entity_id, target_entity_id, edge_type)` where `valid_to IS NULL`. Historical edges are allowed, but overlapping intervals for the same directed relation are rejected.

### Observations (`kg_observations`)

Timestamped facts or notes attached to entities. Append-only log that tracks changes and discoveries over time.

## Search Capabilities

### Full-Text Search (FTS5)

Entity names and descriptions are indexed in an FTS5 virtual table with BM25 ranking. Auto-sync triggers keep the index updated on INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

### Graph Traversal

Neighbors can be retrieved up to 3 hops deep using iterative BFS traversal with optional edge type filtering. Subgraph queries return all entities and connecting edges for a given set of entity IDs. Both traversal paths can optionally filter by historical `as_of` timestamp, so the graph can answer “what was true then?” instead of only “what is true now?”

### LIKE Fallback

If FTS5 is unavailable (rare SQLite builds), search falls back to `LIKE` pattern matching with confidence-based ranking.

## Auto-Extraction

After each successful task, the executor calls `KnowledgeGraphService.extractEntitiesFromTaskResult()` which uses regex-based pattern matching to identify:

- **Technologies:** Common frameworks, languages, and tools (React, Node.js, TypeScript, Docker, etc.)
- **File paths:** Source file references matching common patterns (src/, lib/, app/, etc.)
- **API endpoints:** HTTP method + path patterns (GET /api/users, POST /auth/login, etc.)

Auto-extracted entities are stored with `source='auto'` and `confidence=0.85`.

## Confidence Scoring & Decay

- **Manual entities:** confidence 1.0 (default)
- **Agent-created entities:** confidence 1.0
- **Auto-extracted entities:** confidence 0.85

Confidence decay runs periodically for auto-extracted entities older than 30 days:

- Decay rate: 0.95 per run (5% reduction each cycle)
- Floor: 0.3 (entities never decay below this)

When an entity is created again (upsert), its confidence is boosted by 0.1 (capped at 1.0).

## Context Injection

`KnowledgeGraphService.buildContextForTask()` searches the knowledge graph for entities relevant to a task prompt and builds a formatted context string:

```
KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (known entities and relationships):
- [technology] React: Frontend framework (->uses TypeScript; ->part_of frontend-app)
- [service] auth-service: Authentication microservice (->connects_to PostgreSQL)
```

This context is capped at 5 entities and 1,500 characters. It is **not** injected into the default prompt: with wake-up layers on (the default, `wakeUpLayersEnabled`), memory synthesis excludes the knowledge graph. It is only used by the legacy synthesis path when wake-up layers are turned off. Agents reach the graph through the `kg_*` tools instead. When temporal knowledge is enabled, task-context building uses only currently valid edges by default.

## Agent Tools (10)

| Tool                 | Description                                                                                 |

| `kg_update_entity`   | Update an entity's description, properties, or confidence                                   |
| `kg_delete_entity`   | Delete an entity (cascades to edges and observations)                                       |
| `kg_create_edge`     | Create a typed relationship between two entities, optionally with `valid_from` / `valid_to` |
| `kg_delete_edge`     | Remove a relationship                                                                       |
| `kg_invalidate_edge` | Close an active relationship without deleting its history                                   |
| `kg_add_observation` | Append a timestamped observation to an entity                                               |
| `kg_search`          | Full-text search with optional type filtering                                               |
| `kg_get_neighbors`   | Get connected entities up to 3 hops deep, optionally `as_of` a historical timestamp         |
| `kg_get_subgraph`    | Get entities and edges for a set of entity IDs, optionally `as_of` a historical timestamp   |

## Usage & Testing

You can interact with the knowledge graph by giving the agent natural-language prompts. The 10 `kg_*` tools are registered when the knowledge graph service is initialized. The read tools (`kg_search`, `kg_get_neighbors`, `kg_get_subgraph`) are in the memory lane and load on demand through tool search; the write tools are exposed conditionally. All `kg_*` tools are blocked in group and public channel contexts, and the write tools count as writes in plan, analyze and verifier modes.

### Creating Entities and Relationships

Try prompts like:

- **"Create a knowledge graph of our project stack: we use React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and Redis for caching. The frontend depends on the backend, and the backend connects to both PostgreSQL and Redis."**
- **"Add a person entity for Sarah — she's the tech lead who maintains the auth-service and the payments API."**
- **"Track that we just upgraded from React 17 to React 18 and migrated from Webpack to Vite."** (creates entities + observations)
- **"Track that Redis stopped being part of the stack last month without deleting the old history."** (uses `kg_invalidate_edge`)

### Searching and Querying

- **"Search the knowledge graph for everything related to authentication."**
- **"What technologies do we use? Search the knowledge graph."**
- **"Show me all entities connected to the auth-service and what depends on it."** (uses `kg_get_neighbors`)
- **"Show me what the backend graph looked like on January 15, 2026."** (uses `as_of`)

### Adding Observations

- **"Add an observation to PostgreSQL: experiencing high query latency on the users table since Tuesday."**
- **"Note on the auth-service: migrated from JWT to session-based auth last sprint."**

### Graph Exploration

- **"Get a subgraph of our backend architecture — include the backend service, PostgreSQL, Redis, and the API endpoints."**
- **"What is connected to React? Show me 2 hops deep."**

### Auto-Extraction (Passive)

The knowledge graph also grows passively. After each completed task, the system automatically extracts:

- Technology mentions (React, TypeScript, Docker, etc.)
- File paths referenced in the task (src/components/App.tsx, etc.)
- API endpoints (GET /api/users, POST /auth/login, etc.)

These auto-extracted entities appear with `confidence=0.85` and decay over time if not reinforced.

## Privacy & Isolation

- All entities and relationships are workspace-scoped, and every tool operation (get, update, delete, edges, observations, search, neighbors, subgraph) is filtered by the active workspace; IDs from another workspace are not found
- Entity types are per-workspace (built-in types are seeded per workspace)
- Result sizes are capped: `kg_search` returns at most 50 results, neighbor traversal at most 3 hops and 200 results, subgraphs at most 100 entities and 1,000 edges, observations at most 100
- Deleting a task removes KG observations and edges it created (and entities left orphaned); **Clear All Memories** removes the workspace's graph
