# Security Guide for End Users

This document explains the security model, permissions, and considerations for users who clone and run CoWork OS on their machines.

## Overview

CoWork OS is an AI-powered task automation tool that can execute actions on your behalf. By design, it has capabilities that require careful consideration:

- Execute command tools when the active access profile exposes them
- Read and write files
- Browse the web
- Connect to external APIs

All of these capabilities are governed by the active [access profile](access-profiles.md),
consent rules, and hard guardrails, and are sandboxed where possible.

CoWork OS can also expose **Chronicle**, an opt-in desktop recent-screen context feature. Chronicle keeps a short local passive screen buffer to resolve vague on-screen references, but it does not send those passive screenshots to external providers by itself. Chronicle is configured from **Settings > Memory Hub > Chronicle**, with pause/resume controls and explicit consent gating. See [Chronicle](chronicle.md).

## Permissions Model

### Access Profiles and Workspace Permissions

Each task has an effective access profile. Choose **Ask for approval**, **Approve for me**, **Full
access**, or a validated custom profile from the main composer, or set the default in **Settings >
System & Security > Permissions**. A profile combines sandbox, approval, reviewer, command-tool,
filesystem, domain, and network policy. Workspace booleans remain coarse compatibility gates; the
permission engine still decides whether a specific action should be allowed, denied, or prompted.

| Permission        | Description                                                                                                       | Default            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Read**          | Read files within the workspace                                                                                   | Enabled            |
| **Write**         | Create and modify files                                                                                           | Enabled            |
| **Delete**        | Remove files; still subject to explicit permission rules and approval                                             | Disabled           |
| **Command tools** | Execute commands when exposed by the active access profile; still subject to guardrails, sandboxing, and approval | Profile-controlled |

**Recommendation**: Choose the least-privileged access profile that fits the task. Delete remains
separate and should be enabled only where you trust the AI to remove files.

There is no separate shell enable/disable switch for a new task. Older tasks may retain a legacy
shell field for compatibility, but a named profile is the authority for modern task command-tool
availability. See [Access Profiles](access-profiles.md) for custom rules, inheritance, migration,
and fail-closed behavior.

### Approval System

Approval prompts are now part of a layered permission engine. For a named profile, work inside
the granted boundary is ordinary execution: reads, writes, edits, artifact creation, and bounded
local commands do not create an approval request. A profile with `approval: "never"` denies a
missing boundary instead of waiting for a prompt.

The local runtime keeps popup approvals disabled by default. An `allow` decision runs silently;
an unresolved `ask` becomes an assistant message plus a durable inline **Deny** / **Allow once**
input card. This includes network/on-request access, credential use, data export, MCP and other
external side effects, eligible outside-workspace paths, and explicit opt-outs from automatic
approval. Set `COWORK_APPROVAL_PROMPTS=on` before launch only to restore the legacy queue for
diagnostics. Hard guardrails still block dangerous commands before any approval path, and exact
reasons identify the rule, profile boundary, or guardrail involved. Protected paths,
administrator denials, `approval: "never"`, and automated tasks without human input remain
fail-closed. Pending approval rows and assistant cards fail closed on restart.

When the legacy queue is enabled, you can approve or deny each request individually and persist
some approvals as session, workspace, or profile rules. In the normal runtime, respond to the
inline assistant card; it is the only interactive approval surface and grants **Allow once**.

For the full evaluation order, rule precedence, and persistence model, see
[Permission System](permission-system.md).

The composer access selector uses the same task-level profile model as the permission engine:
**Ask for approval**, **Approve for me**, **Full access**, or a validated custom profile. A profile
combines sandbox, approval, reviewer, command-tool, filesystem, and network boundaries. There is no
separate shell enable/disable switch. Approval is not a substitute for sandboxing, and a custom
profile cannot widen the restrictions inherited from its parent.

### Agent Security with Numbat

CoWork can add a Numbat-backed agent-security decision before the ordinary permission and approval layers. The integration is disabled by default and receives a bounded projection of the pending tool call rather than the full task transcript. In **Monitor** mode it records findings without blocking; in **Enforce** mode a Numbat denial can block the action, but an allow result cannot grant permission, suppress an approval, or weaken sandbox and network controls.

Configure the runtime under **Settings > System & Security > Agent Security** or through `runtime.agentSecurity` in the admin policy. Keep enforcement off until binary provenance, health, and rules have been checked. See [Agent Security with Numbat](agent-security-numbat.md) for defaults, failure policy, rule sources, CLI operations, retention, and incident case bundles.

### Automation Studio Approvals

Main-sidebar Automation Studio classifies each step as read, local write, external write, or data export. New flows default to confirming external work; data exports always pause in a live run. A step's **Skip for safe actions** option applies only to read/local work and cannot suppress external-write or export approval.

Before turning on a flow:

1. run a dry test and inspect the previewed destinations and payload shape;
2. review every required Google scope and the selected account;
3. keep connector allowlists narrow when a flow can call MCP tools;
4. use a dedicated signing secret for each webhook receiver and rotate it by turning off affected flows first;
5. verify any interrupted remote action before approving a post-restart retry;
6. remember that stored-payload redaction is key-based defense in depth, not permission to place secrets in ordinary free-text fields.

See [Automation Studio](automation-studio.md#approval-policy) for the policy matrix, signed webhook controls, cancellation boundaries, recovery rules, and retention behavior.

### Workspace Rule Management

Workspace-local permission rules are visible in **Settings > System & Security** for the active
workspace. From there you can:

- browse workspace-local rules
- remove a rule directly
- persist new workspace rules from approval prompts

Workspace-local rule removal updates both the local SQLite row and the workspace policy manifest.
If the manifest write fails, the database removal still succeeds and the app reports the partial
result.

### Configurable Guardrails

CoWork OS includes configurable guardrails in **Settings > Guardrails** to limit what the agent can do:

| Guardrail              | Description                                                        | Default            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Token Budget**       | Max tokens (input + output) per task; a task's own budget always applies but can only lower this limit | 100,000 (enabled)  |
| **Cost Budget**        | Max estimated cost (USD) per task; a task's own budget always applies but can only lower this limit | $10.00 (enabled)   |
| **Iteration Limit**    | Max LLM calls per task                                             | 50 (enabled)       |
| **Dangerous Commands** | Block dangerous command-tool commands matching patterns            | Enabled            |
| **File Size Limit**    | Max file size the agent can write                                  | 50 MB (enabled)    |
| **Domain Rules**       | Profile- and administrator-controlled destination allow/deny rules | Profile-controlled |

#### Dangerous Command Blocking

The following command patterns are blocked by default:

| Pattern                  | Risk                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| `sudo`                   | Elevated privileges   |
| `rm -rf /` or `rm -rf ~` | Mass deletion         |
| `mkfs`                   | Filesystem formatting |
| `dd if=`                 | Direct disk writes    |
| Fork bombs               | Process exhaustion    |
| `curl\|bash`, `wget\|sh` | Remote code execution |
| `chmod 777`              | Overly permissive     |
| `> /dev/sd`              | Direct device writes  |
| `:(){ :                  | :& };:`               | Fork bomb syntax |

Commands are blocked **before** reaching the approval dialog. You can add custom patterns in Settings.

Trusted-command patterns now feed the permission engine as compatibility rules instead of acting as
the final approval system.

#### Domain Rules

When a profile contains positive domain rules, built-in browser and network tools are restricted to the specified destinations:

- Exact match: `github.com`
- Wildcard: `*.google.com` (matches subdomains, not the apex)
- `**.example.com` matches the apex and descendants
- Deny rules win over allow rules

Arbitrary subprocess networking is not domain-aware and fails closed when a profile requires domain-level enforcement without a domain-aware proxy.

## What the App Can Access

### File System Access

| Scope                                  | Access Level                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Workspace directories                  | Read/Write (based on permissions)                                                          |
| Outside workspace                      | **Approval required** for an explicit external-file operation; traversal otherwise blocked |
| System files                           | **No access**                                                                              |
| `.cowork/policy/**` inside a workspace | **Read-only.** Holds the permission mirror and tool-policy script                          |
| `.git/**` inside a workspace           | **Read-only**, except `.git/info/exclude`                                                  |

**Technical details**:

- Path traversal protection prevents accessing files outside the workspace
- Symlink attacks are mitigated through path normalization
- Implementation: `src/electron/agent/tools/file-tools.ts`

**Protected paths.** Two categories of location are never mutable by tools, even
with unrestricted file access or a granted approval:

- OS locations (`PROTECTED_FILESYSTEM_ROOTS`)
- In-workspace `.cowork/policy/**` and `.git/**`
  (`PROTECTED_WORKSPACE_SEGMENTS`)

Both are enforced in `evaluateWorkspaceFilesystemAccess`
(`src/electron/security/access-profile-paths.ts`) and denied with reason
`protected_path`, which is a hard boundary — no approval or rule can satisfy it.
The rationale is that the policy files decide whether a tool call is allowed, and
git hooks execute on the next commit outside the tool sandbox, so a tool able to
write either could rewrite the rules that govern it. Reads are unaffected.

Relatedly, `copy_file` strips the executable bit from its destination, so copying
an executable file cannot be used to create a new one.

### Workspace Kit Project Access Rules

If a workspace contains a `.cowork/projects/<projectId>/ACCESS.md` file, built-in tools enforce per-project access based on the task's assigned agent role:

- `## Allow` and `## Deny` sections accept agent role IDs (one per line prefixed with `-`).
- Use `all` to match every agent role.
- Deny wins over allow.

Enforcement applies to:

- File/edit/grep/search tools when the path is inside `.cowork/projects/<projectId>/...`
- Workspace-kit context injection (denied projects are excluded from injected context)

Important: these project-role rules do not replace the task access profile for
process execution. Command tools are subject to the profile's sandbox and
filesystem scope, while project-role rules continue to govern the file and
workspace-kit surfaces listed above. Review command-tool approvals carefully,
especially for tasks using a broad access profile.

### Command-tool Execution

When command tools are exposed by the active access profile:

| Aspect                | Implementation                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Working directory     | Restricted to the active workspace and profile-approved roots |
| Environment variables | Minimal set (PATH, HOME, USER, SHELL, LANG, TERM, TMPDIR)     |
| API keys              | **Never passed** to subprocesses                              |
| Timeout               | Maximum 5 minutes                                             |
| Output limit          | 100KB (truncated if exceeded)                                 |

**Security note**: Your API keys and secrets are never exposed to shell commands. The app creates a minimal, safe environment for each command.

`run_command` first requires the active access profile to expose command tools, then applies
guardrails, approval, and the selected access profile. Restricted profiles use the native macOS or Docker sandbox when
available; if no OS sandbox is available (Windows, or Linux without Docker), execution fails closed. The one
exception is an administrator opt-in: when admin policy sets `allowUnsandboxedShell: true` and does not set
`requireSandboxForShell`, CoWork asks you to approve each such command explicitly before it runs with your full
user permissions. That prompt cannot be auto-approved or answered by a "never ask" profile. Scoped filesystem rules are
canonicalized before execution so symlinks and path traversal cannot escape the approved roots.
Domain-scoped network rules are enforced for built-in network tools; arbitrary shell networking is
denied when the active sandbox cannot enforce those domains.

### Browser Automation

The app includes Playwright for web automation:

| Capability         | Details                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Navigate to URLs   | Any URL (user-controlled tasks) |
| Fill forms         | As directed by task             |
| Take screenshots   | Saved to workspace              |
| Execute JavaScript | Within page context only        |
| Mode               | Headless by default             |

**User agent**: `CoWork OS Browser Automation`

### Chronicle Screen Context

Chronicle is separate from browser automation and from dedicated computer-use mouse/keyboard control.

| Capability            | Details                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Passive capture       | Opt-in only; local recent-screen buffer in the desktop app                                                                          |
| Consent / controls    | Explicit consent before first enable; pause/resume from Settings or the tray menu when available                                    |
| Storage model         | Raw passive frames stay in app-local storage and are pruned aggressively                                                            |
| Workspace persistence | Only task-used observations are copied into `.cowork/chronicle/`; linked `screen_context` memory generation can follow when enabled |
| Network behavior      | No automatic provider export; later vision analysis still follows normal approval rules                                             |
| Availability          | Desktop app only; not offered in headless or channel runtimes                                                                       |

Chronicle also introduces a **prompt-injection risk from visible screen content**. A malicious page, document, or chat window can place instructions on screen that the agent may later treat as relevant context. CoWork marks Chronicle text as untrusted screen text, but you should still keep Chronicle paused or off when viewing sensitive or untrusted material, and prefer direct source tools over screen-derived context when a file, URL, PR, or thread can be read directly.

### Internal Addresses Are Blocked for Agent Fetches

Agent-driven network tools (`web_fetch`, `http_request`, scraping, browser
automation) cannot reach internal targets, checked before any allow rule so an
allowlist entry cannot open them:

| Target                                                                  | Reachable |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Cloud instance metadata (`169.254.169.254`, `metadata.google.internal`) | No        |
| Private ranges (`10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`), carrier-grade NAT   | No        |
| Link-local, unique-local IPv6, unspecified address, IPv4-mapped forms   | No        |
| `*.internal` hostnames                                                  | No        |
| Loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`)                              | **Yes**   |
| Public internet, subject to domain policy                               | Yes       |

Loopback is deliberately allowed: the agent legitimately fetches development
servers it has just started, and the app's own loopback services all require
bearer tokens. A DNS name that resolves to an internal address is also refused —
the hostname is resolved before connecting, and re-checked on every redirect hop.

Implementation: `src/electron/security/address-classes.ts`, applied in
`evaluateNetworkPolicy` and in the fetch tools' redirect loop.

### External Link Handling

Links opened from app content go through a single scheme allowlist
(`src/electron/security/safe-external-url.ts`) permitting only `http:`, `https:`,
and `mailto:`. This covers the IPC channel, new-window requests, and
`will-navigate`. Schemes such as `file:`, `smb:`, or an app-registered protocol
are refused, because previewed documents can contain arbitrary hyperlink targets
that the document converter does not validate.

### ACP Remote Agents

Remote ACP delegation is constrained more tightly than ordinary outbound automation:

- registration is scope-gated
- non-operator clients are limited to their own ACP tasks and inbox reads by default
- remote endpoints are validated before invocation
- `https` is preferred, while plain `http` is intended only for loopback development
- private and link-local IP targets are rejected by the remote invoker validation layer
- remote requests use bounded timeouts so bad endpoints cannot hang the main process indefinitely

### Control Plane Exposure

The Control Plane binds to loopback by default. Headless/managed deployments fail closed on `0.0.0.0`/`::` binds unless Tailscale exposure is enabled, the process is running in a privately published container with `COWORK_CONTROL_PLANE_BIND_CONTEXT=container`, or `COWORK_CONTROL_PLANE_ALLOW_INSECURE_PUBLIC_BIND=1` is set as a break-glass override.

Reverse-proxied dashboards should set `COWORK_CONTROL_PLANE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the public HTTPS origin. Only enable `COWORK_CONTROL_PLANE_TRUST_PROXY=1` behind a proxy that controls forwarded headers.

### Product Analytics and Outbound Data

CoWork Pulse installation-linked usage reporting is disabled by default and requires explicit
opt-in. The independent update check sends version/platform/architecture/surface to
`pulse.coworkosapp.com` without an installation identifier and contributes daily request counts.
Model providers, compatible gateways, web search, connectors, channels, and other services also
receive operational requests when configured or invoked.

Opted-in Pulse profiles send bounded daily aggregates to a dedicated Cloudflare Worker/D1
database. The server stores an HMAC pseudonym rather than the raw random profile UUID. No prompt,
response, file content/name, command, URL, raw task/session ID, or provider/model route is included.
Stable pseudonyms make these aggregates longitudinal data, not anonymous data. Operator-configured
OTLP telemetry is independent and includes allowlisted event names, timestamps, and hashed
correlation IDs. See [CoWork Pulse](cowork-pulse.md) for the exact boundaries, retention, reset/delete
semantics, in-flight consent limitations, and [production runbook](../services/pulse-worker/README.md)
for credentials and backup handling.

Task state and application data are persisted locally by default. Prompts, selected memory snippets, files, credentials, and tool payloads leave the machine only when needed for a provider, gateway, connector, channel, browser target, or other external service that you configure or approve. Each service applies its own retention, privacy, and billing terms.

## Data Storage

### Encrypted Settings Storage (SecureSettingsRepository)

Settings stored through `SecureSettingsRepository` are encrypted inside the local SQLite database. The SQLite file itself is a normal `better-sqlite3` database, not a whole-file SQLCipher database:

| Data                              | Location                                                | Encryption                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All Settings                      | `app.getPath('userData')/cowork-os.db`                  | OS Keychain + AES-256                                                                        |
| Database file                     | `app.getPath('userData')/cowork-os.db`                  | Plain SQLite file; selected settings and sensitive fields are encrypted per category/feature |
| Machine ID                        | `app.getPath('userData')/.cowork-machine-id`            | Stable identifier for encryption                                                             |
| Pulse identity/token and settings | Secure settings category `pulse`                        | Encrypted settings; UUID is not derived from machine ID                                      |
| Pulse consent windows/outbox      | Profile SQLite `pulse_consent_windows` / `pulse_outbox` | Ordinary SQLite rows; outbox contains aggregate payload and UUID, not deletion token         |
| Pulse receipts and delivery lease | Profile SQLite `pulse_sent_days` / `pulse_delivery_lease` | Ordinary SQLite rows: acknowledged package IDs/days and the current delivering process     |
| Update release cache              | Profile `update-check-cache.json`                       | Plain release metadata, retrieval time and source; offline fallback only, never "fresh"      |

Typical `userData` locations:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/cowork-os/`
- Linux: `~/.config/cowork-os/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\cowork-os\\`

### Encryption Layers

**Primary: OS Keychain (when available)**

- macOS: Keychain Services
- Windows: DPAPI (Data Protection API)
- Linux: libsecret

**Fallback: App-Level Encryption** (`app2:` records)

- AES-256-GCM encryption
- Key derived via PBKDF2-SHA512 (210,000 iterations) from the per-install machine
  ID, with a random per-record salt stored alongside the ciphertext
- **Fails closed**: if no machine identifier can be established, writing secure
  settings is refused rather than falling back to a key derived from predictable
  paths
- The stored `checksum` covers the ciphertext, not the plaintext; plaintext
  integrity comes from AES-GCM's authentication tag
- Legacy `app:` records written by earlier versions remain readable and are
  re-encrypted to the current format on their next successful load, so upgrades
  migrate in place with no user action

**Unreadable settings**

If a saved category can no longer be decrypted (for example after an OS keychain reset
or a profile restore to another machine), CoWork treats it as missing so you can
re-enter those settings. On the next save it copies the old encrypted row, never
plaintext, into the `secure_settings_unreadable_backup` table and then writes the new
settings, so the original data stays recoverable if the old keychain identity returns.
The MCP server list stays read-only while its saved settings are unreadable.

**Keychain identity check**

CoWork stores a small known value encrypted with the OS keychain key. If a later launch
cannot decrypt it (the app is using a different keychain identity), secure settings are
not saved and an in-app notification explains why, so new data is never encrypted under
a key the original identity cannot read. Restore Keychain access to `CoWork OS Safe
Storage` and relaunch, or relaunch with `COWORK_ACCEPT_NEW_KEYCHAIN_KEY=1` to move
unreadable settings (ciphertext only) into `secure_settings_unreadable_backup` and continue
with the current key. On macOS, settings still readable under a former CoWork identity are
migrated automatically at startup.

See the [Security Hardening Record](security-hardening.md#app-level-settings-encryption)
for what changed and why.

### Settings Categories

All these are stored encrypted in the database:

| Category             | Contents                                                                          |

| `personality`        | Agent personality settings                                                        |
| `skills`             | Managed-skill settings and external skill directory pointers                      |
| `guardrails`         | Safety limits and blocked patterns                                                |
| `hooks`              | Automation hooks configuration                                                    |
| `mcp`                | MCP server configurations                                                         |
| `secure-mcp-tunnels` | Secure MCP tunnel definitions and tunnel tokens                                   |
| `acp`                | ACP-related persisted settings and lifecycle metadata                             |
| `controlplane`       | Control plane settings, tokens, allowed browser origins, and proxy trust settings |
| `channels`           | Channel/gateway configurations                                                    |
| `builtintools`       | Built-in tool settings                                                            |

### Memory Write Governance

The normal local runtime does not show approval prompts. New memory writes
commit immediately, including when an older saved Memory Hub setting selected a
review mode. Memory Write Approval remains an explicit compatibility path for
controlled runs and can stage durable memory writes before commit. Set
`COWORK_MEMORY_WRITE_APPROVAL_MODE` to opt into it:

- `off`: writes commit immediately
- `curated_only`: curated hot-memory edits wait for review
- `external_only`: Supermemory/external-provider writes wait for review
- `background_only`: automatic capture, Dreaming, distillation, and external mirroring wait for review
- `all`: every durable memory write waits for review

Pending rows live in `pending_memory_writes` inside the normal SQLite database.
Since that table is not whole-file encrypted, CoWork blocks sensitive
external-memory payloads before queueing them. Approvals first claim rows as
`applying`, then replay the write with the gate bypassed and mark it `applied`;
duplicate or stale approve attempts fail instead of replaying again. To clear a
backlog after switching to the no-prompt policy, call
`MemoryWriteGate.rejectAllPending()`: it records a system rejection and never
replays the stored payload. The helper only claims rows still marked `pending`,
so an in-flight `applying` replay is not interrupted. Take a SQLite backup before
the one-time cleanup, run it while no replay is active, and verify
`pendingCount()` is zero afterward; do not delete the database to clear this
queue.

### Data Integrity

Each stored setting includes:

- SHA-256 checksum for integrity verification
- Creation and update timestamps
- Automatic corruption detection on load

### What's Stored in the Database

- Workspace configurations
- Task history, events, and logs (including task prompts and timeline messages)
- Channel/gateway configurations
- Channel message history (incoming/outgoing message content for configured channels)
- **All encrypted settings** (API keys, preferences, configurations)

Everything is stored **locally** on your machine. CoWork OS does not upload your database or message history to any CoWork OS servers.

### API Key Security

Your API keys are:

1. Encrypted using OS Keychain when available (macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI, Linux libsecret)
2. Fallback to AES-256 app-level encryption with stable machine-derived key
3. Decrypted only when needed for API calls
4. Never logged or displayed in full
5. Never passed to shell commands or subprocesses
6. Checksummed for integrity verification

### Media and File Validation

CoWork also applies guardrails before certain file and media operations reach external providers:

- large text writes are blocked by the configured file-size guardrail
- binary files are rejected from text-only write paths
- video-generation reference images/videos must be absolute paths, real files, and within supported size/type limits
- external skill directories must be explicit existing absolute paths and are treated as read-only by the app

## Electron Security Configuration

### Security Settings

| Setting            | Value   | Purpose                                    |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `nodeIntegration`  | `false` | Prevents renderer from accessing Node.js   |
| `contextIsolation` | `true`  | Isolates preload scripts from page context |
| `sandbox`          | Default | Uses Chromium sandbox                      |

### Content Security Policy (Production)

```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self';
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
img-src 'self' data: https:;
font-src 'self' data:;
connect-src 'self' https:;
frame-ancestors 'none';
form-action 'self';
```

### macOS Entitlements

| Entitlement                        | Purpose                           |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `allow-jit`                        | Required for V8 JavaScript engine |
| `allow-unsigned-executable-memory` | Required for Electron             |
| `allow-dyld-environment-variables` | Loading native modules            |
| `files.user-selected.read-write`   | Access to user-selected folders   |
| `network.client`                   | Connect to LLM APIs               |

**Not requested**: Camera, microphone, or contacts.

**Opt-in location access**: `get_current_location` requests one-time location permission through the operating system's native dialog (macOS Core Location, Windows Location Services, or Linux GeoClue2). Each invocation requires explicit user consent — the permission is never auto-approved or persisted across tasks. Coordinates are not logged; only accuracy and source are recorded in task events.

## Messaging Channel Security

If you use the gateway feature to connect messaging bots (Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal):

### Security Modes

| Mode          | Description                          | Recommendation                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Open**      | Anyone can use the bot               | Not recommended for production |
| **Allowlist** | Only pre-approved user IDs           | Good for known users           |
| **Pairing**   | Users must enter a code from the app | Best for security              |

### Best Practices

1. **Use pairing mode** for bots accessible to others
2. **Generate new pairing codes** for each user
3. **Revoke access** for users who no longer need it
4. **Don't share bot tokens** publicly

---

## Auto-Update Mechanism

### How Updates Work

For **git clones** (development):

1. Checks GitHub API for new releases/commits
2. User initiates update manually
3. Runs: `git pull`, `npm run setup`, `npm run build`
4. Requires app restart

For **packaged builds**:

1. Uses electron-updater with GitHub releases
2. Downloads from the official repository over HTTPS; the update feed is pinned at
   build time and cannot be redirected at runtime
3. Downloads are explicit — `autoDownload` is off
4. Verifies a detached signature before installing, **when a release signing key
   is configured** (see below)

**Current signing status.** Desktop artifacts are _not_ code-signed: macOS builds
are packaged ad-hoc and Windows builds carry no `publisherName`, which makes
electron-updater's own signature check inactive. Without the detached-signature
scheme enabled, the only integrity control is the `sha512` in `latest.yml` — and
that file is published to the same release as the artifact it describes, so it
does not protect against someone able to replace release assets.

The detached Ed25519 signature scheme closes this and needs no code-signing
certificate, but **ships inert until a key is generated**. See
[Release Signing](release-signing.md) for the current state and how to enable it.

### Supply Chain Considerations

| Risk                         | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Malicious code in update     | Updates are user-initiated, not automatic; detached signature verification refuses a tampered artifact once a signing key is configured                            |
| Tampered release asset       | Detached signature over the artifact requires the private key, which lives only in CI secrets — replacing the asset and its checksum is not sufficient             |
| Compromised dependencies     | Dependencies from reputable sources only                                                                                                                           |
| npm install risks            | Third-party lifecycle scripts disabled via `.npmrc`; `npm run setup` handles native rebuilds explicitly                                                            |
| Malicious MCP registry entry | Installing a remote registry entry requires explicit confirmation showing the exact command; bundled connectors always take precedence over same-named remote ones |
| Malicious plugin pack        | `https://` only, no clone redirects, no credential helper, and the manifest entry point is confined to the pack directory                                          |

### Installing MCP Servers

Installing an MCP server whose definition came from the **online registry**
prompts for confirmation first, showing the exact command, arguments,
environment variable names, publisher, and transport that will be used. Nothing
is spawned before that approval, and the install is refused outright if no
confirmation route is available.

This applies to installs triggered from the marketplace UI _and_ to installs
requested by the agent (`integration_setup`), which matters because the agent can
be influenced by content it reads. Connectors bundled with the app are not
affected and install without a prompt; a remote entry reusing a bundled
connector's name is discarded in favour of the bundled one.

**Note**: If you're security-conscious, review changes before updating:

```bash
git fetch origin
git diff HEAD..origin/main
```

## Security Best Practices

### For General Use

1. **Review command-tool calls** before approving - read what will execute
2. **Use dedicated workspaces** - don't point at sensitive directories
3. **Choose the least-privileged access profile** - only grant what you need
4. **Keep updated** - security fixes come through updates
5. **Protect your API keys** - don't share configuration files

### For Messaging Bots (Telegram/Discord/Slack/WhatsApp/iMessage/Signal)

1. **Never use "open" mode** for public bots
2. **Use pairing codes** for secure user onboarding
3. **Regularly audit** connected users
4. **Revoke access** when no longer needed
5. **For Signal**: Use a dedicated phone number (registration deactivates other Signal instances)

### For Secure MCP Tunnels

1. **Require relay admin auth** before creating tunnel credentials.
2. **Use HTTPS/WSS** for non-loopback relays.
3. **Prefer explicit tool allowlists** over broad access.
4. **Enable read-only mode** for remote inspection workflows.
5. **Rotate caller/client tokens** when a device or remote caller is decommissioned.
6. **Review audit logs** for blocked or unexpected tool calls.

See [Secure MCP Tunnels](secure-mcp-tunnels.md) for the tunnel-specific security model.

### For Development

1. **Review code changes** before pulling updates
2. **Audit dependencies** periodically with `npm audit`
3. **Don't commit** `.env` or settings files
4. **Use separate workspaces** for testing

## Threat Model

### What CoWork OS Protects Against

| Threat                  | Protection                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Path traversal          | Path normalization and validation |
| Command injection       | User approval required            |
| API key leakage         | Encrypted storage, minimal env    |
| XSS attacks             | Content Security Policy           |
| Unauthorized bot access | Multiple auth modes               |
| Malicious skill IDs     | Input validation and sanitization |
| Binary name injection   | Shell metacharacter filtering     |

### What Requires User Vigilance

| Risk                         | User Responsibility             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Approving malicious commands | Review before approving         |
| Workspace selection          | Don't add sensitive directories |
| Bot token security           | Keep tokens private             |
| Update verification          | Review changes if concerned     |

### Out of Scope

- Protection against malicious LLM responses (AI safety)
- Physical access to your machine
- Compromised macOS system
- Malicious code you add to workspaces

---

## Verifying Security

### Check Access Profile And Workspace Permissions

In the app, review the active profile from the composer or **Settings > System
& Security > Permissions**:

- sandbox and approval/reviewer posture
- command-tool availability and network/domain scope
- filesystem roots and read/write/deny rules
- legacy workspace capability gates for older tasks

### Audit Connected Users (Bots)

In the Gateway settings, you can:

- View all connected users
- Revoke access for specific users
- Generate new pairing codes

### Review Pending Approvals

The normal runtime has no popup approval queue. Review unresolved decisions in the task timeline's
assistant message and inline input card, checking the exact operation, destination, and scope before
choosing **Allow once**. The legacy pending-approval badge and queue are available only when
`COWORK_APPROVAL_PROMPTS=on` is explicitly enabled. Pending rows and assistant approval cards fail
closed on restart; retry the operation to receive a fresh decision.

---

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Use GitHub Security Advisories (Security tab > Report a vulnerability)
3. Include reproduction steps and impact assessment

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for full details.

---

## Advanced Security Framework (v0.3.8.7+)

CoWork OS includes a comprehensive security framework inspired by formal verification techniques.

### Tool Groups & Risk Levels

Tools are categorized by risk level for policy-based access control:

| Risk Level          | Tools                                                       | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read**            | `read_file`, `list_directory`, `search_files`               | Low risk, read-only operations                                                                |
| **Write**           | `write_file`, `copy_file`, `create_directory`               | Medium risk, creates/modifies files                                                           |
| **Destructive**     | `delete_file`, `run_command`                                | High risk, usually approval-gated unless an explicit allow rule or mode applies               |
| **System**          | `read_clipboard`, `take_screenshot`, `open_application`     | System-level access                                                                           |
| **Network**         | `web_search`, `browser_*`                                   | External network operations                                                                   |
| **Export / Egress** | mutating `http_request`, `analyze_image`, `read_pdf_visual` | Outbound transfer of local bytes or payloads; reviewed separately from ordinary network reads |

Ordinary uploaded-PDF reading uses the local `parse_document` extraction path. The extracted text is still treated as untrusted document data, but it is not an export/egress operation unless the task uses `read_pdf_visual` or another tool that sends local bytes to an external provider.

High-autonomy modes and session "Approve all" do not silently bypass this export/egress lane.

The computer-use family (`screenshot`, `click`, `type_text`, `keypress`, and related tools on macOS and Windows) is **not** low-risk read-only automation: it can drive arbitrary UI the operator can reach. Treat it as **high trust** and keep the `computer_use` built-in category disabled unless you need it. See [Computer use](computer-use.md).

### Computer use security

- **Helper-targeted macOS permissions**: Accessibility and Screen Recording are granted to the bundled helper runtime, with inline bootstrap at task time and settings shortcuts for recovery.
- **Windows visible-window constraint**: Windows v1 only targets visible, non-minimized windows and may require comparable privilege for elevated apps.
- **Safety UX**: Active sessions use a single-session lock, **Esc** abort, and shortcut guarding to reduce accidental cross-window effects and disruptive global hotkeys during automation.
- **Tool gating**: Policy defers the computer-use lane unless the task signals **native desktop GUI intent**, so gateway and general tasks default to safer tool lanes.
- **Key chord blocklist**: Certain OS-level shortcuts are rejected at the tool layer to avoid session or system disruption.

Full operator and troubleshooting guidance: [Computer use](computer-use.md).

### Monotonic Policy Precedence (Deny-Wins)

Security policies are evaluated across multiple layers in order:

1. **Global Guardrails** - Blocked commands, patterns
2. **Access Profile** - Sandbox, approval, command-tool, filesystem, and network boundaries
3. **Legacy Workspace Permissions** - Read, write, delete, and compatibility flags
4. **Context Restrictions** - Gateway context (private/group/public)
5. **Tool-Specific Rules** - Per-tool overrides

**Key invariant**: Once denied by any layer, a tool cannot be re-enabled by later layers. This prevents policy bypasses.

### Context-Aware Tool Isolation

When tasks originate from gateway bots (WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord/Slack/iMessage/Signal), tools are restricted based on context:

| Context     | Restrictions                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Private** | Target access profile with no additional channel restriction                                                        |
| **Group**   | Target profile plus memory-tool restrictions (including clipboard) and any configured destructive-tool restrictions |
| **Public**  | Target profile plus the strongest configured channel restrictions; system/destructive operations may be blocked     |

This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data in shared contexts.

### Concurrent Access Safety

Critical operations use mutex locks and idempotency guarantees to prevent race conditions:

| Operation                 | Protection                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Pairing code verification | Mutex per channel + idempotency check |
| Approval responses        | Idempotency prevents double-approval  |
| Task creation             | Deduplication via idempotency keys    |

### Brute-Force Protection

Pairing code verification includes protection against brute-force attacks:

| Feature              | Value         | Description                           |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Max attempts         | 5             | Failed attempts before lockout        |
| Lockout duration     | 15 minutes    | Time before retry allowed             |
| Code charset         | 32 characters | Excludes ambiguous chars (I, O, 1, 0) |
| Code length          | 6 characters  | ~1 billion combinations               |
| Estimated crack time | >1000 years   | With lockout enabled                  |

When a user exceeds the maximum attempts:

1. Account is locked for 15 minutes
2. User sees remaining lockout time
3. Attempts counter resets after lockout expires

**Implementation**: `src/electron/gateway/security.ts`

### Command-Tool Sandboxing

On macOS, profile-enabled command tools execute within a generated `sandbox-exec` profile; on Linux and Windows,
the Docker backend provides the equivalent process boundary when configured. Both backends are
fed by the same canonical filesystem evaluator:

- Restricts filesystem access to the active workspace and explicitly approved roots
- Canonicalizes paths and resolves symlinks before allowing reads, writes, or deletes
- Blocks network access unless the active profile and workspace permit it
- Fails closed for arbitrary code with domain-scoped egress that the backend cannot enforce
- Uses a minimal, filtered subprocess environment

**Implementation**: `src/electron/security/access-profile-paths.ts`,
`src/electron/agent/sandbox/macos-sandbox.ts`, and
`src/electron/agent/sandbox/docker-sandbox.ts`

### Imported Capability Security

Imported skills and imported plugin packs now pass through the same install-time security gate before activation.

| Protection                         | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skill ID Validation**            | IDs must match `^[a-z0-9_-]+$` pattern (lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)                                                                    |
| **Path Traversal Prevention**      | IDs containing `..`, `/`, or `\` are rejected                                                                                                            |
| **Binary Name Sanitization**       | Binary names in `requires.bins` must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$`                                                                                           |
| **Command Injection Prevention**   | Shell metacharacters in binary names are blocked before `which` execution                                                                                |
| **Debounced Reloading**            | Rapid skill reloads are debounced (100ms) to prevent race conditions                                                                                     |
| **Staged Imports**                 | Imported skills and plugin packs are scanned before they are moved into active managed storage                                                           |
| **Bundle Heuristics**              | Imported `SKILL.md`, bundled scripts, plugin manifests, declarative connectors, and suspicious URLs are inspected for high-confidence malicious patterns |
| **Package Malware Checks**         | Detected `npx` / `uvx` package references can be checked against live package-malware intelligence                                                       |
| **Quarantine Instead of Activate** | Imports with blocking findings are preserved in quarantine rather than registered into the active runtime                                                |
| **Persisted Scan Reports**         | Managed imports store a security report for warning UX, review, and later integrity checks                                                               |
| **Digest Enforcement**             | If a managed imported bundle changes after install, CoWork can quarantine it again on the next load                                                      |

**Rejected inputs (skill IDs)**:

- `../../../etc/passwd` - Path traversal
- `foo/bar` - Contains path separator
- `skill;rm -rf /` - Special characters

**Rejected inputs (binary names)**:

- `node; rm -rf /` - Shell metacharacters
- `$(whoami)` - Command substitution
- `` `whoami` `` - Backtick execution

Imported bundles that cannot be fully checked against network-backed intelligence are allowed to install only when the local scan is otherwise clean, and the UI surfaces that reduced-confidence state as a warning.

**Implementation**:

- `src/electron/agent/skill-registry.ts` (skill ID validation)
- `src/electron/agent/skill-eligibility.ts` (binary name sanitization)
- `src/electron/security/capability-bundle-security.ts` (bundle scanning, reports, digest verification, and quarantine)
- `src/electron/extensions/pack-installer.ts` (pack install staging and scan gate)
- `src/electron/extensions/loader.ts` (discovery-time integrity checks and quarantine enforcement)

### Codex Security Scan Containment

The bundled Codex Security pack runs repository, diff, and deep multi-pass security scans through first-party plugin-pack skills. The old `security_scan_*` built-in helpers are no longer exposed; scan workflows use the normal workspace-scoped task tools plus bundled skill instructions, references, and scripts.

| Protection                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First-party pack loading**                 | The bundled Codex Security pack is discovered from `resources/plugin-packs/codex-security/` in development and `plugin-packs/codex-security/` in packaged builds. |
| **Normal workspace policy**                  | Scan tasks use the same workspace path, command-tool, network, and approval controls as other CoWork tasks.                                                       |
| **Artifact containment**                     | Scan artifacts should be written under the active workspace, normally `.cowork/security-scans/<repo-name>/<scan-id>/`.                                            |
| **Scoped-path discipline**                   | Scoped scans should use relative repository paths; absolute paths and `..` segments should be rejected by the workflow before scanning.                           |
| **Deep worker completeness**                 | Deep-scan reconciliation expects six usable workers, with all required files present and valid JSONL in worker ledgers/candidates.                                |
| **Report rendering through bundled scripts** | Report validation and HTML rendering should use bundled Codex Security scripts from the packaged plugin pack, not user-provided renderer paths.                   |

These controls keep the scan workflow auditable and keep scan activity within the same policy boundary as normal CoWork task execution.

**Implementation**:

- `src/electron/agent/tools/registry.ts` (normal workspace-scoped tool catalog used by scan skills)
- `resources/plugin-packs/codex-security/` (bundled scan skills, references, scripts, and assets)
- `src/electron/extensions/loader.ts` and `src/electron/extensions/registry.ts` (directory-backed plugin-pack discovery and skill loading)

See [Codex Security Scans](codex-security-scans.md) for scan modes and artifact contracts.

**The security model is transparent and consent-based.** You remain in control of what the AI can do on your machine.

### Guardrails Settings Location

All guardrail settings can be configured at:

- **Database**: stored as an encrypted `guardrails` category inside `app.getPath('userData')/cowork-os.db`
- **UI**: Settings (gear icon) → Guardrails tab

### Settings Migration

Legacy JSON settings files are automatically migrated into encrypted `SecureSettingsRepository` categories:

- Migration creates a `.migration-backup` file before proceeding
- On successful migration, both backup and original are deleted
- On failed migration, backup is preserved for recovery
- Migration logs are available in the app console
