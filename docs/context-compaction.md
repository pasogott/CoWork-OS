# Context Compaction

CoWork OS automatically manages conversation context to prevent token overflow during long-running tasks. When the context reaches its compaction threshold, the system generates a comprehensive structured summary of earlier work — preserving user messages, decisions, file changes, errors, and pending tasks — and installs a smaller replacement history. Each compaction is tracked as one lifecycle with a stable `compactionId`, persisted start/completion/failure events, and a history-generation fence so a late summary cannot overwrite newer user or tool messages.

## How It Works

```
Task starts → Context grows with each LLM turn
                    ↓
        Context reaches 90% capacity
                    ↓
    Proactive compaction triggers:
    1. Truncate oversized tool results
    2. Remove older messages (keep first + pinned + recent)
    3. Generate structured summary via LLM call
    4. Insert summary as pinned message
    5. Flush summary to memory for cross-session recall
                    ↓
    Agent continues near the 55% utilization target
    + comprehensive summary of all prior work
```

### Trigger Threshold

Compaction triggers at **90% context utilization** — aligned with OpenAI Codex CLI's threshold. Some desktop coding tools use ~95%. The 90% threshold balances context preservation with leaving enough room for a rich summary.

| Model              | Context Window | Trigger Point   |
| ------------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| Claude Sonnet/Opus | 200,000 tokens | ~180,000 tokens |
| GPT-4o             | 128,000 tokens | ~115,200 tokens |
| GPT-3.5 Turbo      | 16,000 tokens  | ~14,400 tokens  |

### Compaction Target

After compaction, context is reduced to **~55% utilization**. The freed ~35% provides room for the summary block plus ongoing conversation.

### Summary Budget

The summary LLM call is allocated up to **6,144 output tokens** (~24 KB of structured text). This is scaled proportionally for small-context models (capped at 8% of available tokens) to prevent the summary from dominating the context window.

| Model Context          | Max Summary Tokens | Approximate Summary Length   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 200K+ (Claude, GPT-4o) | 6,144              | ~24 KB / 9 detailed sections |
| 16K (GPT-3.5)          | ~640               | ~2.5 KB / condensed sections |

### Chat Mode History Strategy

Explicit chat sessions use a different history strategy from task execution. Instead of letting the task pipeline grow with every follow-up, CoWork OS compacts long chat sessions into a cached summary plus a recent-message window, then reuses that summary on later turns.

When more messages age out after the first compaction, the next summary call receives the cached summary together with only the newly aged messages. This incremental merge avoids re-summarizing the entire transcript while preserving corrections made after the previous compaction.

This keeps follow-up questions in the same conversation thread while still preserving enough older context for ChatGPT-style back-and-forth.

## Summary Structure

The compaction summary follows a 9-section structured format, designed to capture everything an agent needs to continue work:

1. **Primary Request and Intent** — What the user originally asked for and evolving requirements
2. **User Messages** — Chronological list preserving exact wording of every user message
3. **Work Completed** — Step-by-step walkthrough: files created/modified/deleted, libraries installed, commands executed
4. **Errors and Fixes** — Every error encountered, with error messages and the fix applied
5. **Key Technical Details** — Code patterns, config values, API responses, file paths, function names
6. **Decisions Made** — Architectural choices, approach selections, user-approved directions
7. **Pending/Incomplete Work** — Tasks started but not finished, or requested but not addressed
8. **Current State** — What was actively in progress when compaction triggered
9. **Recommended Next Step** — What the agent should do next

### Handoff Framing

The summary is framed as a handoff document from a previous agent (inspired by Codex CLI's approach):

> _"A previous agent produced the structured summary below to hand off the work. Use this to build on the work that has already been done and avoid duplicating effort."_

This primes the model to treat the summary as authoritative context rather than a lossy cache of its own memory.

## Transcript Formatting

When preparing the dropped conversation for summarization, messages are formatted with role-aware token budgets:

| Message Type    | Character Limit | Rationale                                              |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| User messages   | 3,000 chars     | Highest priority — carry intent, corrections, feedback |
| Assistant text  | 1,500 chars     | Decisions and explanations                             |
| Tool results    | 1,200 chars     | Data retrieved, but large results already truncated    |
| Tool use inputs | 800 chars       | Mostly parameters, less critical                       |

Long messages are truncated with a head+tail strategy (70% head / 30% tail) to preserve both the beginning and any trailing instructions.

The total transcript budget for the summarizer is **90,000 characters** (~22,500 tokens), providing rich context for the summary LLM call.

## Timeline UI

When compaction occurs, the task timeline shows lifecycle events with these exact labels:

- **Context automatically compacting** while a replacement is being generated
- **Context automatically compacted** after the replacement history is installed
- **Context compaction failed** when generation or installation cannot complete

The completed event includes:

- **Collapsible sections** — Each numbered section from the summary is rendered as a `<details>` element
- **Token and message stats** — Shows input/replacement tokens, removed messages, and target/threshold ratios when available
- **Lifecycle metadata** — Shows trigger, phase, duration, fallback status, and a compact summary preview
- **Deduplication** — The legacy `context_summarized` compatibility event is hidden when it belongs to the same `compactionId`, including failed lifecycles
- **Safe persistence** — Compatibility events contain only a sanitized preview/reference, not the full generated handoff

## Safety Mechanisms

### Overflow Guard

After the summary is generated, CoWork OS checks whether inserting it would push context back above 95% utilization. If so, the summary is progressively truncated while preserving the handoff preamble and tag structure.

### Reactive Fallback

If a single message pushes context past 100% without triggering the 90% proactive threshold (edge case), the existing reactive compaction still runs as a safety net with the same enhanced summary prompt and budget.

### Memory Persistence

Compaction source messages and summaries are written to the MemoryService and (if available) the workspace `.cowork/` daily log only after the replacement passes the history-generation fence. These writes are best-effort continuity aids and cannot turn a stale or failed replacement into a durable memory side effect.

When **Durable Runtime Context** is enabled, compaction summaries are also recorded in the durable
runtime-context tables with links back to the source messages they summarize. Overlapping summaries
can link to parent summaries, forming a summary DAG rather than a flat list. Agents can recover these
summaries later in the same active task with `context_recall` (search, then expand a result by
id to follow its source links). See [Durable Runtime Context](durable-runtime-context.md).

### Pinned Messages

The compaction summary is stored as a **pinned message** with the `<cowork_compaction_summary>` tag. Pinned messages survive future compaction rounds — they are never removed by the message-removal strategy.

### History-generation fence

Compaction captures the history array, length, last message, full projection fingerprint, and generation before doing asynchronous summary work. The replacement is installed only if all five still describe the live history. If a follow-up, tool result, or other writer changed the history while the summary was in flight, the runtime emits a retryable failure and preserves the newer history.

An empty provider response never removes messages without a handoff: task compaction fails closed and explicit Chat uses a deterministic raw/truncated fallback. The runtime persists an in-flight lifecycle marker before provider work, and replay reconciles orphaned starts or missing terminal events after a crash. Capacity-recovery telemetry is best effort and cannot strand the compaction lock.

## Task Runtime Snapshots

Context compaction is separate from task-session persistence. Task execution writes a durable runtime snapshot into the task event stream so a task can resume with the same loop state, tool state, recovery state, and verification state after restart.

### Snapshot format

- `conversation_snapshot` remains the persisted event name for compatibility
- the payload schema is `session_runtime_v2`
- the payload includes transcript, tooling, files, loop, recovery, queues, worker, verification, and usage state
- the payload includes compaction lifecycle metadata and the current `historyGeneration`
- the payload includes the explicit-chat summary signature and in-flight lifecycle metadata
- the paired checkpoint payload can also carry a structured summary plus a verbatim evidence packet for post-compaction recall

When replay sees a `context_compaction_started` without a terminal event, it emits a retryable interrupted failure. When a terminal snapshot exists but its terminal event was lost, replay emits the corresponding terminal row so the UI cannot leave a compaction spinner active indefinitely.

### Checkpoint capture

The runtime now writes memory checkpoints natively instead of relying on external hooks:

- **pre-compaction**: always, before messages are removed
- **periodic long-run capture**: every 12 meaningful user/assistant exchanges, deduped by span hash
- **task completion**: when a task produced a non-trivial output or decision

Each checkpoint stores both:

- a compact structured summary for synthesis/restart paths
- a verbatim evidence packet made of exact transcript/message spans with provenance

### Restore precedence

When a task resumes, SessionRuntime restores state in this order:

1. Latest V2 checkpoint payload
2. Latest V2 `conversation_snapshot` payload
3. Legacy checkpoint payload with `conversationHistory`
4. Legacy `conversation_snapshot` payload with `conversationHistory`
5. Event-derived fallback conversation

If a legacy payload is restored, the next checkpoint rewrites it into V2 so the stored state is upgraded automatically.

## Configuration

Compaction behavior is controlled by constants in `src/electron/agent/executor-helpers.ts`:

| Constant                               | Default | Description                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `PROACTIVE_COMPACTION_THRESHOLD`       | `0.90`  | Context utilization ratio that triggers compaction |
| `PROACTIVE_COMPACTION_TARGET`          | `0.55`  | Target utilization after compaction                |
| `COMPACTION_SUMMARY_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | `6144`  | Maximum tokens for the summary LLM call            |
| `COMPACTION_SUMMARY_MIN_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | `500`   | Minimum viable summary budget                      |
| `COMPACTION_SUMMARY_MAX_INPUT_CHARS`   | `90000` | Maximum transcript characters sent to summarizer   |

### Event Flow

1. **Pre-compaction checkpoint** — Before any message removal, the runtime writes a durable checkpoint with structured summary + verbatim evidence packet
2. **Lifecycle start** — `context_compaction_started` records the stable ID, trigger, phase, generation, and accounting inputs
3. **Pre-compaction flush** — If context slack < 1,200 tokens, a durable summary is flushed to memory _before_ any messages are removed
4. **Proactive compaction** — At 90% utilization, `proactiveCompactWithMeta()` compacts to 55%
5. **Summary generation** — `buildCompactionSummaryBlock()` calls the LLM with the structured prompt
6. **Generation fence** — The runtime rejects the replacement if live history changed during asynchronous summary work
7. **Pinned insertion** — Summary upserted as a pinned `<cowork_compaction_summary>` user message
8. **Generation-fenced memory commit** — Source messages and summary are written to MemoryService only after the replacement is accepted
9. **Durable context write** — If enabled, source messages and summary rows are stored in task-scoped durable runtime context
10. **Lifecycle completion** — `context_compaction_completed` persists replacement/token/message stats; failures emit `context_compaction_failed`
11. **UI event** — `context_summarized` remains as a preview/reference-only compatibility event and is correlated by `compactionId`
12. **Reactive fallback** — Standard `compactMessagesWithMeta()` runs if proactive didn't trigger
