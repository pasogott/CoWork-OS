# ACP / acpx Integration Guide

How to integrate an OpenClaw + acpx-style coding agent stack into Cowork OS.

## Status Update

Cowork now supports more than ACP discovery-only plumbing:

- remote ACP agent registrations can be persisted locally
- `acp.task.create` can invoke remote agents over an A2A-compatible JSON-RPC/HTTP bridge
- `acp.task.get` can poll remote task status/results
- ACP task state is persisted locally so task ids survive app restarts
- `acp.task.cancel` can cancel both local delegated work and remote A2A-compatible tasks
- orchestration tools can target `acp_agent_id` so local DAGs can delegate to local or remote ACP agents
- remote ACP invocations are approval-gated under the same policy model as other governed actions
- ACP child tasks inherit the effective [access profile](access-profiles.md). The external acpx
  adapter cannot enforce CoWork's bounded filesystem and network rules, so bounded tasks are
  rejected before the adapter is started; acpx execution requires an explicitly unrestricted
  Full access profile and compatible administrator policy. The adapter's own consent flags remain
  separate and are never silently promoted to `approve-all`.
- The [approval-boundary validation record](approval-boundary-validation.md) covers the native
  runtime smoke, bounded ACP rejection, cancellation cleanup, and the known platform limits.
- ACP task and inbox access is scope-aware so non-operator clients are limited to their own work by default
- remote endpoints are validated and timed out before invocation to reduce bad registrations and unsafe outbound calls
- acpx prompt results are classified once, for initial prompts and follow-ups alike. A stop
  reason says why a turn ended, not that the task succeeded: `end_turn` completes only with a
  final response or a file the agent reported editing that exists in the workspace (otherwise
  the task needs user action); `max_tokens`/`max_turn_requests` become budget-exhausted partial
  success, or a continuation decision without usable output; `refusal` and missing or unknown
  reasons fail with `contract_error`; `cancelled` is persisted as a cancelled task. A local
  cancellation that races a successful prompt wins. The raw stop reason is kept in the task log.
  ACP completion keeps verification requirements and never records Playbook success learning.

## Context

**OpenClaw + acpx** is a coding-agent stack where:

- **acpx** is a headless CLI for the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com)
- Orchestrators talk to coding agents (Codex, Pi, Gemini, and similar tools) over a **structured protocol** instead of PTY scraping
- acpx provides: persistent sessions, prompt queueing, typed output (thinking, tool calls, diffs), crash reconnect, and a single command surface for multiple agents

**Cowork OS** already has:

- Full **ACP server** on the Control Plane (`acp.discover`, `acp.task.create`, `acp.agent.register`, etc.)
- Coding agents invoked via **bash + PTY** (`run_command` wrapping `codex exec`, `claude`, etc.)
- A persisted ACP registry for local and remote agents
- `spawn_agent` / `orchestrate_agents` support for ACP-targeted delegation, including remote A2A-compatible agents

## Integration Options

### Option 1: acpx as CLI Wrapper (Lowest Friction)

Use acpx instead of raw `codex` / `claude` commands. Cowork’s executor keeps using `run_command`, but the command becomes `acpx codex "..."` instead of `codex exec "..."`.

**Benefits:**

- Structured output (`--format json`) for automation
- Session management, prompt queueing, cooperative cancel
- No protocol changes; drop-in replacement for existing coding-agent flows

**Implementation:**

1. **Update coding-agent skill** to prefer acpx when available:

   ```bash
   # Detect acpx
   which acpx || npx acpx@latest --version

   # One-shot (replaces codex exec)
   acpx codex exec "fix the failing tests"

   # Persistent session (replaces codex with background)
   acpx codex sessions ensure
   acpx codex "fix the failing tests"
   ```

2. **Add acpx detection** in `cli-agent-detection.ts`:
   - Extend patterns for `acpx codex`, etc.
   - Render `CliAgentFrame` for acpx-backed tasks

3. **Use JSON output** when running from tools:

   ```bash
   acpx --format json --cwd $WORKDIR codex exec "review this PR" | jq -r 'select(.type=="tool_call") | .title'
   ```

**Files to touch:**

- `resources/skills/coding-agent/references/full-guidance.md` — add acpx patterns
- `resources/skills/codex-cli/references/full-guidance.md` — acpx as preferred path
- `src/shared/cli-agent-detection.ts` — detect `acpx codex`
- `src/electron/agent/tools/shell-tools.ts` — ensure `acpx` is in `CLI_AGENT_ENV_KEYS` if it needs special env

---

### Option 2: acpx as ACP Runtime (OpenClaw-Style)

Add an “ACP runtime” mode so that when the user says “run this in Codex”, Cowork spawns acpx as the ACP backend instead of raw Codex. acpx manages the Codex process and speaks ACP.

**Flow:**

1. User: “Run this in Codex”
2. Cowork creates a child task with `capability_hint: "cli-agent"` and `runtime: "acp"`
3. Instead of `run_command("codex exec ...")`, Cowork invokes acpx (e.g. `acpx codex "..."` or acpx’s programmatic API if available)
4. acpx spawns Codex, runs the task, returns structured output

**Implementation sketch:**

- Add `runtime` to task config: `"native"` (default) vs `"acp"`
- In executor/tool routing, when `runtime === "acp"` and target is a coding agent, call acpx instead of raw CLI
- Optionally: acpx `--format json` output can be parsed and surfaced as structured events (tool calls, thinking, diffs) in the timeline

**Files to touch:**

- `src/electron/agent/executor.ts` — route to acpx when `runtime: "acp"`
- Task types — add `runtime?: "native" | "acp"`
- `src/electron/agent/tools/shell-tools.ts` — acpx invocation path
- Skills — document when to use `runtime: "acp"`

### Option 3: acpx Connects to Cowork as ACP Client

Run acpx in a mode where it connects to Cowork’s Control Plane and registers as a **remote ACP agent**. Cowork’s orchestrator discovers it via `acp.discover` and delegates via `acp.task.create`.

**Flow:**

1. acpx runs as a service, connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` (Cowork Control Plane)
2. acpx calls `acp.agent.register` with `name: "codex-via-acpx"`, `capabilities: [{ id: "code", ... }]`
3. User: “Run this in Codex”
4. Cowork’s executor calls `acp.task.create` with `assigneeId: "remote:codex-via-acpx"`
5. acpx (or a bridge) must poll for tasks or receive them via Control Plane events
6. acpx spawns Codex, runs the task, updates task status/result

**Current state:** Cowork can already forward remote ACP work to an external endpoint and poll it for status. The remaining work for a specific acpx deployment is mostly adapter-specific:

- a bridge or service that exposes the acpx-managed agent behind an HTTP endpoint
- authentication/header conventions for that endpoint
- any extra event streaming if you want richer-than-polling status updates

**Files to touch:**

- New bridge: `src/electron/acp/acpx-bridge.ts` — connects to Control Plane, registers as remote agent, polls `acp.task.list` or listens for `acp.task.updated`, invokes acpx for each task
- Control Plane — ensure remote agents can receive task assignments (already supported; bridge does the rest)

---

### Option 4: Cowork as acpx Target (Reverse)

Configure acpx to use Cowork as an ACP server. OpenClaw’s config shows:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "openclaw": {
      "command": "openclaw acp --url ws://127.0.0.1:18789 --token-file ~/.openclaw/gateway.token ..."
    }
  }
}
```

So acpx’s “openclaw” agent runs OpenClaw’s ACP bridge, which connects to OpenClaw’s gateway. For Cowork to be an acpx target, you’d need:

- A Cowork ACP bridge that speaks the same WebSocket/ACP format acpx expects
- Cowork’s Control Plane already has `acp.*` methods; the question is wire format compatibility with [ACP spec](https://agentclientprotocol.com)

If compatible, you could add a `cowork` agent to acpx:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "cowork": {
      "command": "node ./cowork-acp-bridge.js --url ws://127.0.0.1:18789 --token $TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

Then `acpx cowork "run this task"` would delegate to Cowork’s agent.

## Recommended Path

**Short term:** Option 1 (acpx as CLI wrapper). Minimal changes, immediate benefit from structured output and session management.

**Medium term:** Option 3 is now practical. Register acpx (or an adapter) as a remote ACP agent and let Cowork delegate to it through the shipped remote-invocation path.

**Long term:** Option 2 or 4 if you want deeper runtime-level integration, richer structured event streaming, or bidirectional ACP peer interoperability.

## Remote Endpoint Safety Notes

When registering a remote ACP agent:

- prefer `https` endpoints
- plain `http` is only appropriate for local loopback development
- private/link-local IP targets are rejected by the remote invoker validation layer
- requests are bounded by a timeout, so a bad remote endpoint cannot hang the CoWork main process indefinitely

Operational guidance:

- only register remote agents you trust to receive delegated prompts and task context
- use operator/admin scopes for registration and broad task inspection
- expect normal task approval/policy gates to still apply before external delegation happens
