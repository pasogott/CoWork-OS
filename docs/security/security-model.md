## Channel Security

### Security Modes

CoWork OS supports three security modes for external channels (Telegram, Discord, etc.):

| Mode          | Description                         | Use Case                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Pairing**   | Users must enter a 6-character code | Recommended for most cases    |
| **Allowlist** | Only pre-approved user IDs allowed  | Enterprise deployments        |
| **Open**      | Anyone can interact                 | Trusted private channels only |

### Context Policies

Different security settings can apply to DMs vs group chats:

- **DM (Direct Messages)**: Capabilities allowed by the target workspace's access profile
- **Group Chats**: The target profile plus additional memory/tool restrictions by default

This treats group messages as higher risk than direct messages, where shared context could expose sensitive data.

## Policy Manager

The policy manager implements a **layered permission engine** with hard-stop precedence. The
task-level contract is documented in [Access Profiles](../access-profiles.md).

### Access Profile Resolution

Before an individual tool request is evaluated, CoWork resolves the explicit task profile or the
configured default, validates inheritance, applies administrator constraints, and projects the
effective profile onto the task workspace. A missing or invalid named profile becomes an
unavailable read-only profile and fails closed. The later request-level layers cannot widen that
profile boundary.

### Layer 1: Global Guardrails

Dangerous patterns that are always blocked:

- `sudo` - Privilege escalation
- `rm -rf /` - Destructive deletions
- `curl | bash` - Remote code execution
- Fork bombs, disk formatting commands

### Layer 2: Workspace Permissions

Per-workspace controls:

- **Read**: Allow reading files
- **Write**: Allow creating/modifying files
- **Delete**: Allow file deletion
- **Command tools**: Derived from the selected access profile; the legacy `shell` bit is consulted
  only for unprofiled compatibility tasks
- **Network**: Allow network-capable tools to run at all

These remain coarse capability gates. They do not replace explicit rules, workspace policy files, or
mode defaults. A workspace with `network: true` can still require approval for export-sensitive
requests, and a workspace with `network: false` blocks both ordinary web access and outbound export.

### Layer 3: Context Restrictions

Based on message context (private/group/public):

- Memory tools denied in group contexts
- Clipboard access denied in shared contexts

### Layer 4: Tool-Specific Rules

Individual tool permissions and approval decisions:

- Named profiles evaluate the concrete operation and boundary; in-scope local mutations can run
  without an approval lifecycle, while protected, external, sensitive, or explicitly-asked
  operations still require consent or a denial
- Command tools may prompt, auto-review, or run without a prompt according to the selected profile;
  a separate shell toggle is not part of new-task configuration
- Domain-scoped rules can allow or deny `web_fetch` / `http_request` per destination
- Exact reasons and matched scopes are surfaced in the prompt when available

### Layer 5: Legacy Permission Modes And Fallback

After the access profile is applied, a legacy permission mode and the denial fallback tracker may
provide compatibility defaults for the individual decision:

These mode descriptions apply to older profile-less tasks and compatibility callers. New tasks
with a named access profile use the boundary rules above instead of translating the profile into a
legacy prompt category.

- `default`, `plan`, `accept_edits`, `dangerous_only`, `dont_ask`, and `bypass_permissions` define baseline behavior
- `dangerous_only` is the middle ground between `accept_edits` and full autonomy: it auto-allows safe reads, edits, and a conservative read/test shell subset, while still prompting for destructive actions, privacy-sensitive non-workspace access, MCP/external side effects, and ambiguous shell commands
- `dont_ask` and `bypass_permissions` no longer suppress `data_export` prompts
- soft denials can escalate to a direct prompt after repeated hits
- hard guardrails and explicit deny rules are never bypassed

## Outbound Data Movement

CoWork now models outbound transfer separately from generic network reads.

### Egress Classes

- `web_fetch` is a network read and stays in the `network_access` lane
- `http_request` stays in `network_access` only for plain `GET` or `HEAD` requests with no body and no custom headers
- mutating or payload-carrying `http_request` calls are classified as `data_export`
- `analyze_image` and `read_pdf_visual` are also classified as `data_export` because file bytes are sent to external model providers
- `parse_document` is the local document/PDF text extraction path. Uploaded PDF excerpts and parser results remain untrusted document data, but ordinary PDF text reading does not become `data_export` unless the task uses an outbound tool such as `read_pdf_visual`.

### Destination Controls

- workspace `network` permission is still the first gate
- allowed-domain guardrails still apply to raw web requests
- permission rules can now target a specific domain, optionally scoped to one tool
- a profile `domainRules` allowlist/deny list is evaluated deny-first and cannot be widened by a
  later permission rule or approval

### Approval Context

When CoWork asks for approval on export-sensitive actions, the prompt can include:

- the target domain, method, or provider
- the direct file source being exported
- whether the task recently read untrusted imported content

Session-wide "Approve all" and high-autonomy permission modes do not silently allow this class of
action. Export stays fail-closed to an explicit prompt.

## Automation Studio Security

Structured flows add a workflow-specific safety layer on top of the normal permission engine:

- activation validates the graph, required fields, bounded settings, connected Google account/scopes, preview status, and signed-webhook secret references;
- every live run is pinned to an immutable active version, so saving a draft cannot change live starter/account/action policy;
- `external_write` and `data_export` actions require approval under the default/safe flow policies, and data export cannot be bypassed by a per-step safe override;
- external writes and exports receive at most one automatic attempt;
- custom MCP tools are resolved live, checked against the Routine connector allowlist, and validated against the tool's current input schema before invocation;
- signed webhooks require HTTPS, apply network policy, reject private/reserved destinations before and after DNS resolution, pin the validated address, reject redirects, cap bodies/timeouts, and include HMAC plus idempotency headers;
- signing secrets stay in secure settings and workflow definitions retain only a secret id;
- durable input/output storage applies sensitive-key redaction and version-aware retention cleanup;
- cancellation propagates into CoWork agent tasks, Google requests/uploads, and signed webhooks. Arbitrary MCP servers may not support mid-call abort, so remote completion must still be verified;
- interrupted running/retrying steps resume in an explicit outcome-verification approval state rather than being replayed automatically.

See [Automation Studio](../automation-studio.md#secrets-connector-policy-and-data-handling) for the complete workflow runtime and operator contract.

## Sandboxing

Sandboxing is a technical process boundary, not an approval mode. The task access profile selects
both independently: the sandbox constrains spawned processes, while approval and reviewer settings
decide when the agent must ask. The shared filesystem evaluator applies profile roots and deny
rules before either backend runs. If a backend cannot represent a requested restriction, CoWork
fails closed rather than silently widening access.

### macOS (Primary)

Uses native `sandbox-exec` with generated profiles:

- Deny-by-default policy
- Explicit allows for workspace, approved roots, and required system paths
- Network isolation unless the active profile explicitly enables it
- Mach service restrictions
- Domain-scoped arbitrary-process egress is denied because `sandbox-exec` has no domain-aware proxy

### Docker (Cross-platform)

For Linux and Windows systems:

- Container isolation per command
- Only centrally approved workspace and additional roots are mounted
- CPU and memory limits
- Network mode: none (default) or bridge
- Read-only root filesystem
- Domain-scoped arbitrary-process egress is denied unless a domain-aware proxy is available

### Fallback

When sandboxing unavailable:

- Process isolation with timeout
- Output size limits
- Environment variable filtering
- Restricted agent shell/code execution fails closed rather than falling back to an unsandboxed process
- Only when admin policy sets `allowUnsandboxedShell: true` (and not `requireSandboxForShell`) can the user approve an individual `run_command` to run unsandboxed; that approval is always explicit and never auto-approved

## Filesystem Protection

### Protected Paths

These paths can never be written to:

- `/System`, `/Library`, `/usr`, `/bin` (macOS)
- `C:\Windows`, `C:\Program Files` (Windows)

### Workspace Boundaries

By default, and subject to the effective access profile, tools can access:

1. The active workspace directory
2. Profile-declared additional workspace roots and matching filesystem rules
3. Legacy explicitly allowed paths for unprofiled compatibility tasks
4. Temporary directories where the legacy temporary-workspace compatibility path applies

Profile filesystem rules are evaluated separately for read, write, and delete. `write` grants do
not grant delete, explicit deny rules win, and a finite profile scope cannot be widened by an
external-file approval. Existing prefixes and symlinks are canonicalized before the decision.

### Path Traversal Prevention

Multiple validation layers prevent `../` escape:

- Path normalization
- Relative path detection
- Workspace prefix checking
- Symlink canonicalization
- Deny-first profile rule evaluation with component-boundary checks

## Encrypted Settings Storage

Application settings stored through `SecureSettingsRepository` are encrypted inside the local SQLite database. The main `cowork-os.db` file is a normal `better-sqlite3` database, not a whole-file SQLCipher database. Treat rows outside encrypted repositories as local plaintext unless their feature explicitly documents per-field encryption.

### Encryption Hierarchy

```
+------------------------------------------+
|     OS Keychain (Primary)                |
|  macOS Keychain / Windows DPAPI / libsecret |
+------------------------------------------+
              |
              v (fallback when unavailable)
+------------------------------------------+
|     App-Level Encryption                 |
|  AES-256-GCM + PBKDF2 key derivation    |
+------------------------------------------+
```

### Features

| Feature                    | Description                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-layer encryption** | OS keychain preferred, AES-256 fallback |
| **Stable machine ID**      | Survives hostname/user changes          |
| **Integrity checks**       | SHA-256 checksums per setting           |
| **Safe migration**         | Backups preserved on failure            |
| **Health diagnostics**     | Status APIs for debugging               |

### Protected Categories

All sensitive settings including API keys, preferences, and configurations are stored encrypted:

- LLM provider settings and API keys
- Voice/TTS/STT configurations
- Search provider credentials
- Channel/gateway settings
- All user preferences

### Memory Write Governance

Durable memory writes can be approval-gated before commit. The Memory Hub setting `memoryWriteApprovalMode` supports:

- `off`: commit immediately
- `curated_only`: stage curated hot-memory writes
- `external_only`: stage Supermemory/external-provider writes
- `background_only`: stage automatic capture, Dreaming, distillation, and external mirroring writes
- `all`: stage every durable memory write

Pending approvals are stored in `pending_memory_writes`. Because this table is in the normal SQLite database, CoWork blocks sensitive external-memory payloads before they are persisted to the queue. Approval replay claims a pending row as `applying` before sending it to the target memory service, so duplicate approve attempts do not replay the same write twice.

## Rate Limiting

| Operation           | Limit     |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| LLM calls           | 10/minute |
| Task creation       | 10/minute |
| Settings changes    | 5/minute  |
| Standard operations | 60/minute |

## Security Harness

CoWork OS includes a deterministic security harness for changed high-risk code paths:

`prepare -> scan -> validate/debate -> dedup -> prove -> eval coverage`

Run it with `npm run qa:security:harness`. It scans changed files in sensitive boundaries such as
tool policy, agent tools, sandboxing, Browser Workbench automation, Electron IPC, connector source,
and regression policy. Confirmed findings are deduped into a Mission Control payload, and runs with
`--db --profile-id` also write Core Harness trace/failure rows for Mission Control.

The harness is advisory by default. It does not change ordinary task verification, agent step
completion, or runtime approval behavior unless a developer explicitly runs it with
`--fail-on-findings`.

Confirmed security or production-policy fixes should run the harness with `--confirmed-fix` so
`scripts/qa/eval-cases/security-harness-regressions.json` is created or updated with durable
regression coverage. See [Security Harness](security-harness.md).

## Brute-Force Protection

For pairing codes:

- Maximum 5 attempts
- 15-minute lockout after max attempts
- Automatic cleanup of expired codes

## Concurrency Safety

### Mutex Locks

- Pairing operations protected by named mutexes
- Prevents race conditions in verification

### Idempotency

- Approval operations tracked with idempotency keys
- Prevents double-processing of the same request

## Prompt Injection Defenses

CoWork OS implements multiple layers of defense against prompt injection attacks.

### System Prompt Hardening

The agent system prompt includes security directives that resist common attack vectors:

| Directive                | Purpose                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Confidentiality**      | Prevents disclosure of system instructions in any format             |
| **Output Integrity**     | Resists behavioral modification (language changes, suffix injection) |
| **Code Review Safety**   | Treats code comments as data, not instructions                       |
| **Autonomous Operation** | Resists response pattern manipulation                                |

### Input Sanitization (`InputSanitizer`)

Preprocesses all inputs to detect:

- **Encoded instructions**: Base64, ROT13, hex-encoded payloads
- **System impersonation**: `[SYSTEM]`, `[ADMIN OVERRIDE]`, mode activation attempts
- **Content injection**: Hidden instructions in documents, emails, HTML comments
- **Code injection**: `AI_INSTRUCTION:`, `ASSISTANT:` patterns in code

### Output Monitoring (`OutputFilter`)

Post-processes LLM responses to detect potential:

- **Canary compliance**: Verification strings like `ZEBRA_CONFIRMED_9X7K`
- **Format injection**: Word count suffixes, tracking codes
- **Prompt leakage**: System prompt section headers, YAML configuration

### Content Sanitization

| Source                           | Protection                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tool Results**                 | Injection patterns in web/file content annotated; imported file reads can also carry an explicit untrusted-content banner |
| **Memory Context**               | Stored memories sanitized before injection                                                                                |
| **Skill Guidelines**             | Validated and filtered before system prompt injection                                                                     |
| **Imported Files / Attachments** | Provenance recorded so later export approvals can show what content recently entered from outside the workspace           |

### Defense Philosophy

These defenses are layered rather than purely reactive:

- suspicious patterns are still logged and annotated instead of blindly discarded
- system-prompt hardening and sanitization still provide the first line of defense
- imported content is marked with provenance so the runtime can distinguish workspace-native data from externally supplied data
- outbound transfer from that content is no longer treated as just another network read; it routes through export-sensitive approval with destination and source hints

The result is intentionally asymmetric: reading rich external content stays easy, but moving local or
recently imported content outward now fails closed to a review step.
