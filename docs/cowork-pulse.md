# CoWork Pulse

CoWork Pulse is an explicitly opt-in, content-free analytics stream for one product question:

> How many installations reach value, and how many return to do useful work again?

Pulse is disabled by default. CoWork asks once, after your first successful task (not during
onboarding), and the choice is always available under **Settings → CoWork Pulse**. Until you
answer, nothing is recorded as a decision. The CLI provides the same controls:

```sh
cowork telemetry status
cowork telemetry show
cowork telemetry on
cowork telemetry off
cowork telemetry send
cowork telemetry reset --yes
cowork telemetry delete --yes
```

`show` describes exactly what would happen next, using the same selector as sending:

| State          | Meaning                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queued`       | The exact payload the next send attempt submits, provided consent is still on             |
| `candidate`    | An estimate for the eligible UTC day; nothing is queued yet                               |
| `ineligible`   | Nothing can be sent: Pulse is off, deletion is pending, or no fully consented day exists  |
| `already_sent` | The collector acknowledged this day; `send` will not resend it                            |

Opening Settings or running `show` never creates an outbox row. Pulse keeps **one daily aggregate
record** per fully consented UTC day; failed or unconfirmed requests may be retried with the same
record and package ID, and the collector keeps the first row. This is idempotent delivery, not
exactly-once networking. `send` reports `sent`, `busy`, `already_sent`, `no_eligible_day`,
`cancelled_by_state_change`, or `error`.

The separate `/v1/latest-version` update request is identifier-free. It includes only version,
platform, architecture, and surface, and is used only by **automatic** (startup) checks, with a
2-second limit before falling back to GitHub. Checking manually in Settings goes directly to
GitHub. It is suppressed in CI and tests and is reported as **Daily Update Checks**, never as
unique users. The client keeps no request cache; the last release it retrieved is kept only as an
offline fallback and is labeled with its retrieval time.

Example request shape:

`GET /v1/latest-version?version=0.5.54&platform=macos&arch=arm64&surface=desktop`

## Identity and consent

- The installation ID is a random UUID generated only after opt-in. It is scoped to the active
  CoWork profile and is not derived from hardware, hostname, account, or `.cowork-machine-id`.
  Explicit identity reset also creates an ID, even while collection is off.
- The server immediately converts the UUID to an HMAC pseudonym and never stores the raw UUID.
- Every decision (on, off, reset, delete) is persisted first, in one short database transaction,
  and increments a local revision. Turning Pulse off closes the consent window, discards queued
  packages and aborts this process's in-flight request. Any request that was already admitted
  may still complete, but its result is discarded: a late response can never turn consent back
  on, restore an identity, or record a sent day. Re-enabling retains the UUID.
- Rotating the ID starts a new measurement identity with its own consent window (days consented
  under the old identity are never reported under the new one) and discards the old local
  deletion token; it does **not** delete old server records. Delete remote data before rotating
  if you want the previous identity removed. Rotation is blocked while a deletion is pending.
- Deleting remote data turns reporting off **before** any request, then asks the collector to
  delete that identity, using the deletion token and the endpoint the identity enrolled with.
  Deletion is reported as complete only when the collector acknowledges it. If the request fails
  or times out, Pulse stays off and shows **Reporting off; deletion pending**; the target and
  token are kept (including across restarts) so you can retry, and opting in again is blocked
  until deletion is confirmed. A retry is maintenance you request, not an opt-in; restart never
  resumes usage delivery. A non-identifying daily deletion counter remains on the server.
- Limit: the client fence cannot retract a request the server already accepted. A delayed
  enrollment accepted after deletion would recreate a server identity; closing that gap needs a
  server-side deletion barrier, which this client does not claim.

## Included

- Coarse client version, operating-system family, CPU family, and runtime family.
- Daily counts of root sessions/tasks started, completed, failed, cancelled, and useful outcomes. Bundled synthetic sample tasks are excluded from these counts, tool-event categories, and task-linked model-error counts.
- A coarse active-minutes bucket.
- Daily tool-use counts reduced to six closed categories.
- Counts of approval requests/denials and tool/LLM failures.

## Never included

Prompts, responses, file names or contents, commands, URLs, workspace/task/session IDs, custom tool
names, model/provider routes, account data, hostnames, raw errors, or precise activity timestamps.

The collector source, closed validation schema, D1 migration, retention job, and deployment guide
live in [`services/pulse-worker`](../services/pulse-worker). Daily installation rows are retained for
24 months. `/v1/admin/summary` returns aggregate reached-value and mature 7/30-day return cohorts
and is protected by a server-side admin token.

Requests necessarily pass through Cloudflare's HTTP edge, which may transiently process a source
IP for abuse prevention under Cloudflare's platform controls. Pulse application code never reads,
stores, exports, or exposes that IP, and there is no IP column in D1.

## Destination and storage

| Lane             | Destination                                                      | Storage and control                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Usage Insights   | Local profile database                                           | Detailed local usage; enabling the dashboard is not Pulse consent                              |
| Update discovery | `https://pulse.coworkosapp.com/v1/latest-version`                | D1 daily request counts by version/platform/architecture/surface; independent of Pulse consent |
| CoWork Pulse     | `https://pulse.coworkosapp.com/v1/installations` and `/v1/daily` | Dedicated `cowork-pulse` Cloudflare Worker and D1 database                                     |
| Operator OTLP    | Operator-configured `runtime.telemetry.otlpEndpoint`             | Separate opt-in admin policy; retention belongs to that endpoint's operator                    |

Local `SecureSettingsRepository` category `pulse` encrypts the UUID, deletion token, consent,
revision, identity start and endpoint, any pending deletion target, and delivery status.
`pulse_consent_windows`, `pulse_outbox`, `pulse_sent_days` (acknowledged package IDs and days)
and `pulse_delivery_lease` (which process is delivering) are ordinary tables in the profile's
SQLite database, not whole-file encrypted storage. The outbox contains the UUID and aggregate
payload but not the deletion token. `update-check-cache.json` holds the last retrieved release
metadata with its retrieval time and source, not task content.

D1 stores an HMAC of the profile UUID, a SHA-256 deletion-token hash, consent version, daily
aggregates, package IDs, first-active/value dates, and server receipt/update timestamps. The
content-free promise excludes precise **client activity** timestamps; server receipt times and
UTC day boundaries still exist. This is pseudonymous longitudinal data, not anonymous data.

The daily cleanup runs at **03:17 UTC**. Usage rows and update-check rows older than 24 months
are deleted. Installation rows with no remaining usage and no update for 730 days are removed.
Active installation metadata and aggregate deletion counters do not have a blanket 24-month
expiry. Deletion applies to the live database; this implementation does not purge Cloudflare
recovery snapshots or separate operator backups. Verify backup policy before promising physical
erasure from every recovery medium.

## API contract

| Method and path            | Authentication                                 | Result                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /v1/status`           | Public                                         | Service/schema liveness; does not query D1                     |
| `GET /v1/schema`           | Public                                         | Human-readable collection summary, not a machine JSON Schema   |
| `GET /v1/latest-version`   | Public                                         | GitHub release metadata; accepts version/platform/arch/surface |
| `POST /v1/installations`   | Body contains random deletion token            | Enrolls profile; `202`                                         |
| `POST /v1/daily`           | `Authorization: PulseWrite <deletionToken>`    | First accepted row per profile/day; `202`                      |
| `DELETE /v1/installations` | `Authorization: PulseDeletion <deletionToken>` | JSON body `{ "installationId": "<uuid>" }`; `200`              |
| `GET /v1/admin/summary`    | `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>`          | Aggregate SQL summary; `401` without valid token               |

Enrollment body keys are `schemaVersion`, `installationId`, `deletionToken`, and `consentVersion`.
Schema version is `1`; consent version is `2026-09-04`. Daily payload fields are defined in
[`src/shared/pulse.ts`](../src/shared/pulse.ts), with independent server validation in
[`services/pulse-worker/src/index.ts`](../services/pulse-worker/src/index.ts). Unknown/missing
fields are rejected. Counters are integers in `0..100000`; request bodies are capped at 16 KiB.
Package IDs are SHA-256 of `<installationId>:<period.start>`. Never put tokens in URLs.

## Measurement definitions

| Metric                       | Current meaning                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opted-in installations       | Enrolled profile identities still in D1, not all downloads, people, or devices; enrollment waits for an eligible flush                  |
| Sessions/tasks started       | Distinct local session keys and root task rows created during the UTC day; eval tasks excluded when the schema supplies the eval marker |
| Useful tasks                 | Completed root tasks whose terminal status is null, `ok`, or `partial_success`; a completion proxy, not user-confirmed value            |
| Active-minutes bucket        | Sum of completed root tasks' `last_run_duration_ms`, bucketed as `0`, `1-15`, `16-60`, `61-240`, `240+`; not foreground human time      |
| Reached value                | Server identity has a first accepted package with `usefulTasks > 0`                                                                     |
| 7/30-day return              | Any useful day 1–7 or 1–30 after first value, among identities old enough for that window; not exact day-7/day-30 retention             |
| `daily.active_installations` | Count of submitted daily rows, including zero-work days; label this **reporting profiles** in reports                                   |
| Daily Update Checks          | Requests counted by the update endpoint, not unique installations                                                                       |

Return rate is `returned_7d / mature_7d` (or the 30-day equivalents). Report an unavailable rate
for zero denominator. Empty-table SQL sums currently return `null`; do not present them as a
measured percentage. The summary includes recent daily rows and update counts for 30 days.
It returns counts, not an investor dashboard or a user listing.

Opt-in bias, older clients, offline use, deletion, multiple profiles, profile cloning, identity
rotation, and missing daily packages affect coverage. No opt-in count provides a denominator for
all installations. Public GitHub/npm adoption signals remain a separate measure. No dedicated
event currently measures how often consent was offered or declined.

## Delivery behavior and known limitations

- Desktop/daemon service checks after 30–300 seconds and every six hours; enabling requests a
  flush too. CLI `send` makes an explicit flush. A continuous consent window for the current
  identity must cover the whole previous UTC day; first enrollment can therefore be delayed by
  more than a day. After upgrading from a build without revisions, eligibility for the existing
  identity starts conservatively at upgrade time.
- The encrypted settings record, consent windows and outbox are changed in one SQLite
  transaction, so the settings store must use the same connection as the Pulse service. This is
  checked before every transaction; if it ever differs, decisions and sends fail with
  `settings_connection_mismatch` and nothing is changed.
- Desktop timer and Settings share one service instance. Concurrent flushes in one process share
  one attempt; across processes sharing a profile, a 30-second delivery lease allows one sender
  and the other reports `busy`. The lease and the captured revision are re-checked before each
  network stage and before any result is saved; an expired owner cannot save or proceed.
- Each flush queues the previous-day package if it is eligible and not yet acknowledged, then
  sends the oldest queued package. Requests time out after 10 seconds. The queued bytes are
  immutable, so a retry resubmits the identical package. An acknowledged upload records a
  receipt and removes the outbox row in one transaction; that day is never resent. A timeout
  after the server committed is ambiguous and may be retried; the collector deduplicates it.
  There is no historical backfill for days when no flush ran, nor a queue age/size cap.
- On upgrade there is no reliable historic sent-day ledger (`lastSentAt` may describe a backlog
  upload), so one previously sent day may be submitted again once; the server's idempotent
  acknowledgement absorbs it and the local receipt prevents repeats afterwards.
- First-active/value dates use first arrival, not the earliest date across late packages.
  Duplicate daily submissions still update installation metadata. Do not treat cohorts as
  audit-grade measurements until replay and out-of-order handling are hardened.
- LLM error counts query the whole profile's `llm_call_events`; they do not apply the root/eval
  task filter used for task counts. Tool classification is heuristic and uses closed categories.
- Update discovery skips the CoWork endpoint in CI/tests. Manual checks use GitHub with an
  8-second total deadline; automatic checks allow the CoWork endpoint 2 seconds, then GitHub
  8 seconds. Offline results are shown as cached with their retrieval time and cannot start an
  install. The Pulse aggregate service itself has no CI/test guard; keep test profiles opted out
  or use a local collector.
- `COWORK_PULSE_ENDPOINT` overrides the destination for identities created while it is set, not
  the updater URL. An identity stays pinned to the endpoint it was created with, so changing the
  override later never redirects its deletion token. Use only trusted collectors and disposable
  profiles for local tests.

Operator OTLP still sends allowlisted event names, exact event timestamps, and hashed task/event
correlation IDs. It excludes raw IDs, payload values, and payload keys. Those OTLP timestamps
are separate from Pulse's daily aggregate contract.

## Implementation map and release gate

- Client collection/storage: `src/electron/telemetry/pulse-service.ts`.
- Shared types: `src/shared/pulse.ts`; IPC wiring: `src/shared/types.ts`, preload and IPC handlers.
- Consent controls: `PulseSettingsPanel.tsx`, the first-success prompt (`PulseConsentPrompt.tsx`), `src/cli/main.ts` and `direct-run.ts`.
- Startup: Electron and daemon entrypoints; updater: `src/electron/updater/update-manager.ts`.
- Server/schema: `services/pulse-worker/src/index.ts` and `migrations/`.
- Separate operator export: `src/electron/telemetry/task-event-exporter.ts`.

The collector was deployed and verified on 2026-09-06. This does not mean a Pulse-enabled desktop
or npm release was published. Existing installations need that client version and explicit
consent. See the [production runbook](../services/pulse-worker/README.md) for deployment evidence,
admin access, maintenance, and checks still outstanding.
