/**
 * The memory repo as an app-owned filesystem root (docs/memory-repo-phase1-design.md §6.4).
 *
 * `evaluateWorkspaceFilesystemAccess` treats the running memory repo's root specially, before
 * any workspace or profile rule:
 *  - every mutation anywhere under it is denied with `protected_path` (a hard boundary: only
 *    `MemoryRepoService` writes the repo);
 *  - a read is allowed only inside a task scope whose `memoryRepo` injection layer is on
 *    (private gateway, memory retained, not a sub-agent, no `<no-memory>`), otherwise denied
 *    with `memory_repo_unavailable`.
 *
 * The root is registered by the repo bootstrap when the service starts and cleared when it
 * stops. The per-task read flag travels in an AsyncLocalStorage scope that the executor
 * opens around each tool call, so it reaches the evaluator without threading a parameter
 * through every file tool. Outside such a scope (IPC handlers, background services) reads are
 * denied: fail closed.
