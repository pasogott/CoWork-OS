# Connectors

This folder contains connector templates and reference implementations.

Connectors are MCP servers that expose enterprise APIs (Salesforce, Jira, etc.) to CoWork OS via tools. They are designed to run outside the desktop app so they can be deployed locally or as a managed service.

Templates:

- `connectors/templates/mcp-connector`

Reference implementations:

- `connectors/salesforce-mcp`
- `connectors/jira-mcp`
- `connectors/hubspot-mcp`
- `connectors/zendesk-mcp`
- `connectors/servicenow-mcp`
- `connectors/linear-mcp`
- `connectors/asana-mcp`
- `connectors/okta-mcp`
- `connectors/resend-mcp`
- `connectors/discord-mcp`
- `connectors/google-workspace-mcp`
- `connectors/figma-mcp`
- `connectors/vercel-mcp`
- `connectors/monday-mcp`
- `connectors/finance-data-mcp`
- `connectors/maps-mcp`
- `connectors/home-assistant-mcp`
- `connectors/rhino-mcp`
- `connectors/blender-mcp`
- `connectors/comfyui-mcp`

Local app connectors that accept file paths, such as Rhino, Blender, and
ComfyUI, must scope file and directory arguments to a configured project root
(`COWORK_ARCH_PROJECT_ROOT` or `COWORK_WORKSPACE_ROOT`) before dispatching to
the bridge/API. They should also reject non-local bridge URLs and undeclared
tool names.

See `docs/enterprise-connectors.md` for the Phase 1 connector contract.
